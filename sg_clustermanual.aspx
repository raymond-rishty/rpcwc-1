        RPC Small Group Cluster Manual</h4>
    <p>
        We live in a postmodern, broken, dysfunctional world that cries out for truth, trust
        and touch. The small group is the ideal framework in which the Holy Spirit disciples,
        counsels and equips through ministry of His Word in the context of community, exercising
        and expressing the one another dynamic evidenced in His Word. This dynamic looks
        to help others with whom we enter into close relationship to apply the biblical
        teachings basic to discipleship. In an atmosphere of trust and commitment, believers
        invest in one another for the long haul. The group becomes a haven of familiarity
        and support, and a place of encouragement and refreshment for fellow pilgrims in
        a dry and weary land. Since the image of the Vine and the branches from John 15
        serves as the backdrop to the RPC vision, these small groups are called "Clusters"
        and look to gain, grow in and give life found in Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Purpose</strong>: The purpose of Clusters, RPC's basic small groups, includes
        assimilation, edification, and shepherding care. Clusters are a means to cultivate
        health and vitality in becoming a branch growing deeply in the Vine of life, filling
        West Chester with the hope of life.</p>
    <p>
        Cluster involvement is basic to Christian discipleship in building community, cultivating
        caring, encouraging commitment and enhancing communication for helping believers
        to grow in love for God, for one another and for neighbor. These small groups provide
        for the protection (<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Heb.+3:12-14&height=300&width=300"
            title="Hebrews 3:12-14" class="thickbox">Heb. 3:12-14</a>.) and direction (<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Heb.+10:23-25&width=300&height=300"
                title="Hebrews 10:23-25" class="thickbox">Heb. 10:23-25</a>) of the sheep,
        as mandated in <a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Acts+20:28-32&width=300&height=300" title="Acts 20:28-32"
            class="thickbox">Acts 20:28-32</a>. Mercy-mindedness will be cultivated in caring
        for one another in the group and for others outside the group, both inside and outside
        the church, believers and unbelievers.</p>
    <p>
        Clusters are also one means by which elders can carry out their God-ordained shepherding
        role through direct, personal involvement in the groups and by ensuring the sheep
        are plugged in to God's means of growth.</p>
    <p>
        Clusters will provide a point of connection and a forum for communication and ministry.
        Each Cluster could have its own e-mail and/or telephone prayer chain, which could
        be part of the prayer network for the church as a whole.</p>
    <p>
        Relationships among Cluster members can be built inside and outside the Cluster
        meeting times through social interaction, prayer chains, and mutual ministry involving
        all or some of the group members. One dimension of the early church included sensitivity
        to mercy ministry and interaction with the outside world for the sake of the gospel.
        (see <a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Acts 2:44-47&width=300&height=300" title="Acts 2:44-47"
            class="thickbox">Acts 2:44-47</a>). While the primary role of the Cluster is
        to cultivate "Finding life in Christ," the group should be sensitive to "Bringing
        life to others." This could be reflected in areas such as prayer, periodic projects,
        openness to guests, and support of a missionary or ministry cause.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Formation</strong>: Current RPC small groups will be renamed and will need
        to review their structure and purpose to conform to the new Cluster focus and format.
        New groups will be formed by request (e.g., via written sign-up, e-mail, web registration,
        call). Those wanting to be part of a Cluster can either plug into an existing group
        or request to be part of a newly organized group.</p>
    <p>
        Being part of a Cluster is considered second in priority only to attendance in Sunday
        morning activities of SBS and worship. Every RPC member will be invited and encouraged
        to be part of a Cluster, although participation is strictly voluntary. Enlistment
        will be encouraged at the RPC Orientation Class, and various other ways of promotion
        (RPC brochure, sharing in service, shepherding, etc.). Various factors such as geographical
        location or expressed preferences (e.g., time/day availability, age, geography,
        inclusion of children) will be taken into consideration in new Cluster formation.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Make-up</strong>: There is great benefit to variety in small group involvement
        with one another, such as variety of age or spiritual maturity. The older can be
        a blessing to the younger and vise versa. However, there is also benefit in being
        able to deal with common concerns associated with station in life, such as being
        newly married or the challenges associated with being a seasoned saint. For this
        reason, Clusters may reflect heterogeneous diversity or homogeneous commonality.</p>
    <p>
        Clusters will have the latitude to receive others into the group or to invite others
        to visit a meeting. The heart of the Cluster will likely be a committed core who
        have signed the Cluster Covenant, with others involved to a certain degree for a
        certain period of time according to opportunity and interest. This core will be
        able to carry out the Cluster covenant commitment and pursue the purpose as stated
        above.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Duration</strong>: Participants will ordinarily make a one-year, renewable
        commitment to a particular Cluster. While it would be ideal for Cluster members
        to get to know other RPC members not part of their Cluster for the purpose of building
        broader RPC community and to avoid becoming ingrown, stale or cliquish, mandatory
        reshuffling of groups can be counterproductive. Building of relationships within
        the group, commitment to one another and group cohesiveness often develop over time.
        For this reason, one-year Cluster covenants can be renewed. Each Cluster will have
        an expected two-year duration, which can be continued, with approval of the Session.
        The act of annual renewal, however, does allow for individual members to opt out
        of a particular Cluster group.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Meeting frequency</strong>: Clusters will ordinarily meet weekly from September
        through May. Church history has shown the <em>weekly</em> meeting best serves the
        goals of building community, fostering commitment, and cultivating growth. This
        decision, however, will be made by each group itself. Each Cluster will also have
        the latitude to decide if it will meet weekly during the summer or adopt a different
        schedule (e.g., once a month).</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Meeting length</strong>: The Cluster meeting will ordinarily be 90 minutes
        in length, starting and stopping punctually to allow for participants to plan their
        schedules, arrange for childcare and accommodate other personal variables.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Meeting day</strong>: The particular day and time on which a Cluster gathers
        will be left to the discretion of the group. There may be times when Clusters will
        be asked not to meet in order to accommodate church meetings, such as on Wednesdays,
        which currently is the designated time for Session and Diaconate meetings.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Meeting place</strong>: Ordinarily Clusters will gather in the warm confines
        of homes, yet the church building could be used if desired. A single host home could
        be used or the group could alternate between or among various host homes, on a weekly
        or monthly rotating basis.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cluster size</strong>: The optimal size of a Cluster to allow for openness,
        establish a solid core and fit comfortably in most homes is 7 to 12 adults.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Format</strong>: The format of the Cluster meeting will follow the pattern
        of the early church expressed in <a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Acts+2:42&width=300&height=300"
            title="Acts 2:42" class="thickbox">Acts 2:42</a>. This format will not only
        include the various elements below, but will disciple participants in the elements.
        For example, in addition to engaging in prayer, they will learn <em>how</em> to
        pray, how to be <em>varied</em> in prayer, how to pray for needs <em>deeper</em>
        than remedy of a trouble, and to be personally <em>open</em> in prayer. These elements
        are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Apostles' teaching (Bible study [topical or textual, directed dialogical rather
            than lecture], possible sermon discussion). Ordinarily, all groups will be studying
            the same materials concurrently, in an effort to foster common direction for the
            church as a whole; </li>
        <li>Fellowship (being together as believers, interaction as believers, dynamic of "one
            another" passages in and outside the confines of the meeting, all to live out the
            common bond in Christ); </li>
        <li>Breaking of the Bread (share life together; Christ-centered, grace-based; weekly
            refreshments as social setting; may include occasional meals together);</li>
        <li>Prayer (corporate communion with God, support of one another, tool for Kingdom work,
            varied [praise, thanks, confession, intercession], conversational).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The order in which the elements of the Cluster meeting occur can vary, particularly
        so as not to give short shrift to ministry of prayer or the Word. Often, the element
        that occurs first can occupy the lion's share of the time.<br />
        <p>
            <strong>Leadership</strong>: Teachers may be elders or others approved by Session.
            Cluster Coordinators, who will not necessarily be the teachers of the Cluster, will
            manage the groups. Ordinarily, Cluster Coordinators will not be elders but will
            be men and women or couples <em>trained</em> in leading and who receive <em>continuing</em>
            oversight and support. The primary role of the Cluster Coordinator is to facilitate
            the group meeting (getting the meeting started, seeing that it ends on time, and
            that a proper balance of ministry of prayer and the Word is maintained), to coordinate
            general logistics (e.g. teaching responsibilities, study materials, who brings dessert,
            list of meeting places, etc.), and to serve as the contact for group communication.
            All Cluster Coordinators will meet on a regular basis (e.g., quarterly) for encouragement,
            edification and communication.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Oversight</strong>: At the time being, the Session will have direct oversight
            of Clusters, rather than having oversight through one of the standing committees
            of the church. The rationale is that Clusters are primarily concerned with shepherding.
            Oversight will include care of the groups as well as approval of all curriculum
            and teachers.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Relation to Elder Shepherding Groups</strong>: Ideally, every member of
            RPC would be involved in a Cluster, and Shepherding Groups would be comprised of
            groups of Clusters with no remainder. However, with the fluidity and incompleteness
            of Cluster involvement, it is best for Shepherding Groups to remain distinct from
            Clusters, maintaining their own rosters. Elders, however, will encourage Cluster
            alignment and participation by those in their Shepherding Groups as a vehicle to
            discipleship and growth in the Vine of Life.</p>
