        Ladies Cooking Club</h4>
    <p>
        The RPC Ladies Cooking Club is a time of fellowship for any woman who enjoys trying
        new recipes and having dinner out with friends. Each month we gather at a different
        home and cook a delicious meal that we enjoy together. This has become a night that
        many women of the church look forward to each month. Here is what some ladies are
        saying about it:</p>
    <p>
        "The RPC Ladies Cooking Club is one of my favorite fellowship activities because
        it gives me a chance to unwind with the girls. It allows for time together in a
        casual and fun atmosphere."</p>
    <p>
        "Going to cooking club is not only a fun experience where you can learn new recipes,
        but also you create more personal relationships with ladies in the church, in an
        atmosphere that helps everyone to feel more comfortable with each other."</p>
    <p>
        "Cooking club is a great time to get to know other women in the church in a way that
        we can't on a Sunday morning. It's also a great opportunity to invite friends from
        outside the church to join us for the fun"</p>
    <p>
        "Its a wonderful and relaxed time of fellowship while enjoying yummy food too...how
        can you go wrong?!!"</p>
    <p>
        "Through cooking club, I've gotten to know women of all ages at church, learn new
        cooking techniques (the best way to get flavor from garlic, what rhubarb looks like,
        how to cut up a butternut squash) and of course, taste some delicious recipes!"</p>
    <p>
        "Cooking Club is a great opportunity to try out new recipes and connect with friends
        in our church community."</p>
