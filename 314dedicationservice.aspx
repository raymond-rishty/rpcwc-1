            <i>Our God and Father, who am I, and what is this people, that we should be able thus
                to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given
                you. We are sojourners in this world. Our days on the earth are like a shadow, and
                there is no abiding. O </i><i>Lord</i><i> our God, all this abundance that we have provided
                    for renovation of this house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all
                    your own. I know, my God, that you test the heart and have pleasure in uprightness.
                    In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I
                    have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.
                    O </i><i>Lord</i><i>, the God of our fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,keep forever
                        such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts
                        toward you, that you may receive all glory and honor, through Christ our Lord I

        <b>Prayer of Thanks</b></h3>
    <p>
        O Lord our God—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—who is all wise, all good, all powerful,
        full of mercy, grace and love, who dwells in light unapproachable yet also with
        those who are humble in heart, we give thanks to You for Your grace and wisdom from
        conception of the idea of a ministry house to its completion. We acknowledge Your
        mighty hand. As you led Your people of old through the wilderness, so You led us
        at Your pace, in Your way, to bring us to this day when we can proclaim our thanks
        for all you have done. We thank You…

            &amp; people</li>

        <li>for the assurance of Your wisdom and care in the continuing needs we will face</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Our Father in heaven, we thank You for Jesus whom You gave to be the Vine of Life.
        We thank You for engrafting us by Your Spirit into Him for our life and for the
        privilege of knowing Him and serving Him where You have raised us up as Your church.
        We thank You for the plans You have for us. We express these thanks in the name
        above all names, Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
