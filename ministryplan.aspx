    <p>
        Small groups for mutual encouragement, edification and exercise of mission
    </p>
    <p>
        Mercy ministry</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Key Text:</strong></p>
    <p>
        John 15:5 <em>I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him,
            he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.</em></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Key Doctrine:</strong></p>
    <p>
        Union with Christ as the source of all life and fruitfulness</p>
    <p>
        Gives great encouragement in that roots us in Christ as our source of life and that
        looks to Him for the resources necessary for life and ministry and not to our own.&nbsp;Reminds
        us that we are His church.&nbsp;Emphasizes a grace-based ministry that finds its
        life, growth, fruitfulness and competency in Christ.&nbsp;The better we are connected
        to Christ, the better we will thrive and function in His service.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The purpose and mission, governed by the values, exercised in the means will strengthen
        (i.e., vitality) us as a branch of the Vine and lengthen us (i.e., effectiveness
        and influence) for His work where He has planted us.</p>
