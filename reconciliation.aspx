        <span style="font-style: italic">Everything</span> that was needed for salvation
        and a restored relationship with God, which was impossible for us, <span style="font-style: italic">
            God himself</span> did through the work of his Son, Jesus Christ. The whole
        Old Testament speaks of God's promise of salvation and presents previews to help
        us understand what God would do on sinners' behalf. Then in God's perfect timing:</p>
    <p>
        But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born
        under the law, to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption
        as sons.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Galatians+4:4-5&height=300&width=300" title="Galatians 4:4-5"

        What exactly did Jesus do to reconcile sinners to God?</p>

        <li>In order to satisfy the justice of a holy God, Jesus gave his life as a sacrifice
            by <span style="font-style: italic">dying on the cross</span> as a sinless substitute.<a

                    Good Friday</span>. Jesus arrived at the cross with no sin of his own, and
            so was able to serve as a substitute for sinners. On the cross: (1) Jesus atoned
            for<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Ephesians+1:7;+Hebrews+9:24-28&height=300&width=300"
                title="Ephesians 1:7; Hebrews 9:24-28" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
            (paid the price for, removing the guilt) the sins of those he came to save; (2)
            he suffered the full wrath of God to satisfy the justice<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+3:23-26;+1+John+4:9-10&height=300&width=300"

            God <span style="font-style: italic">raised Jesus from the dead</span>. This is
            what we celebrate at <span style="font-style:italic;">Easter</span>. His resurrection means that Jesus' mission to redeem
            (pay the price for) a people for God was a success.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=1+Thessalonians+1:9-10&height=300&width=300"

            God had provided the way for forgiveness of sins, newness of life and reconciliation
            of sinners with himself, all without compromising his character. In fact, God has
            provided no other way. As Jesus says, "I am the way, and the truth and the life.
            No one comes to the Father except through me."<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=John+14:6&height=300&width=300"

            Bible's message of life has to do with Jesus.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In answer to the question, "Who crucified Christ?" the ultimate answer of the Bible
        is: "For <span style="font-style: italic">God</span> so loved the world that he
        gave his only Son;"<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=John+3:16&height=300&width=300" title="John 3:16"

                the will of the Lord</span> to crush him."<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Isaiah+53:10&height=300&width=300"
                    title="Isaiah 53:10" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
        God himself accomplished salvation and so all the credit goes to him.</p>

        So we see that God did not just ignore the sin of those he decided to save. Nor
        did he simply issue a pardon. No, God paid for the sins of his people by sending
        his Son to give his life a ransom<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Mark+10:45;+John+10:14-15,27&height=300&width=300"
            title="Mark 10:45; John 10:14-15,27" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
        for them and to provide the righteousness (perfect obedience) required by his law
        so that they could be acceptable to Him.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+3:19-26;+Romans+8:1,31-34&height=300&width=300"
