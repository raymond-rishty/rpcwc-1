        Dear Prayer Partners and Friends of Chester County Womens Services,
    </p>
    <p>
        It is with great excitement I share some outstanding news regarding something we
        have all been praying for! <strong>Over the past three years the number of abortions
            committed at the West Chester Planned Parenthood has decreased!!! </strong>Not
        by just a little, but by a significant amount! Our prayers are working, your investment
        into this ministry is making a difference and your committment to CCWS Medical <u><strong>
            will</strong></u> continue to bring life to Chester County through our ultrasound
        services! Once our men, women and youth meet their little preborn baby through ultrasound
        they are choosing life. <strong>In fact, at CCWS Medical, 90&ndash;95% choose life after
            an ultrasound!</strong> I've said it before, I'll say it again&hellip; together
        we are strong! We are journeying together in the name of the Lord. Thank you for
        all you do to make a difference! Please help us keep up the good fight through your
        prayers and continued financial partnerships. Let's keep these numbers on the decline
        until the West Chester Planned Parenthood decides to leave our county!
    </p>
