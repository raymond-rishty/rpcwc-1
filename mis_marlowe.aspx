        Dear Kingdom Partners,</p>
    <h3>
        Training
    </h3>
    <p>
        We are thankful for a very rich summer. The entire Marlowe family lived in New York
        City as a part of MTW’s pre-field training program for new workers going to the
        field. Jeff directed the program. Mischa helped teach the language acquisition techniques,
        focusing on phonetics and cultural issues. We had an incredible group of nineteen
        new workers, ten interns, and five mentors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alex directed the childcare program consisting of 21 kids. Eric, Magali, and Michael
        were part of an internship program that consisted of childcare, field work in churches,
        and a mentoring/discipleship component to help them grow spiritually and understand
        more of God’s diverse world through missions. All were involved in different churches
        of different ethnic populations. They helped to organize and teach VBS in the inner
        city, taught ESL to newly arrived immigrants, and were involved in all facets of
        these great PCA church plants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a link to the blog and summary newletter written by the program participants.
        Hopefully, it will give you a glimpse into a bit of what they experienced during
        their pre-field training in New York:</p>

    <h3>
        Family News</h3>
    <p>
        Magali will be attending Gainesville State College this fall as a freshman. She
        is living in Athens, GA where her brother Eric is attending the University of Georgia.
        Pray for both of them as they begin a new year. Alex has moved back home and is
        looking for a job! After four years of college, he is ready! He is looking for a
        job in teaching (theater and English) as well as in local professional theater in
        the Atlanta area.

    <p>
        In Christ,
