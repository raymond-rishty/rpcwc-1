        A Changing World</h3>
    <p>
        October 2008

    <p>
        Dear Partners,
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        We trust that you are well despite the chaotic economic and political news these
        past few weeks. Despite all that is happening in a world that seems a bit out of
        control at the moment, I need to remind myself that Jesus is on the throne!
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        God is indeed ruling. I realized this as I recently traveled and worked with our
        workers and national partners from various parts of the world over the past month.
        <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
        Central Asia</h3>
    <p>
        It’s amazing what God is doing in parts of the world where one would have no idea
        that people are interested in the Gospel. I just returned from a country in the
        heart of Central Asia – a Muslim country with a Soviet history where I helped facilitate
        our leadership in defining vision and structure for our work in the Muslim world.
        I thoroughly enjoyed the culture in this country – painful history, great food,
        and intriguing people. Our work is very new to this country within the past year.
        One of the highlights for me was being able to interact with three national leaders
        in training. It was exciting to hear their testimonies of coming from a Muslim and
        communist context as well as their vision for bringing people to Christ and seeing
        churches planted.
        <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
        West Africa</h3>
    <p>
        Authentic partnership is becoming the new paradigm for missions. As we seek to empower
        our national brethren, we are seeing more discussions around the table about vision
        and strategy that are putting westerners and nationals on an equal footing. This
        is no easy task. I just finished facilitating meetings among African leaders, the
        MTW team on the ground in West Africa, and key PCA churches committed to West Africa.
        We worked on vision, expectations of each other, roles and responsibilities, and
        learning how to treat each other with all the cross cultural issues that are involved.
        In this West Africa partnership, composed of three countries with significant Muslim
        populations, our role is changing as we come along to serve and train. But the vision
        and strategy are being cast by local leadership. As I reviewed the goals at the
        end, the vision is bold. The goal of the partnership is to plant 125 churches in
        the next five years in Islamic regions of the involved countries in West Africa.
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        We continue to thank you for your prayers and commitment to seeing churches planted
        and leaders trained!
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        For His Kingdom,
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Jeff and Mischa</p>
