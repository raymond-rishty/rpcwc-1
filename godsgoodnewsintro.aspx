        That's a quote from Augustine, Bishop of Hippo (A. D. 401) in his book, Confessions.
        He hits on something basic to us as human beings. God created us for relationship
        with Himself and we are restless without Him.
    </p>

        That relationship is what the Bible talks about. It's a subject that reaches to
        the very core of life. It addresses the issue of the restlessness, discontentment,
        loneliness, out-of-whackness, ill-at-easeness, wondering-what-it's-all-aboutness
        we all face in life.</p>
