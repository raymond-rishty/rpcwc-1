        <div>At Rocky Point Lighthouse VBS, kids learn to shine God's Light. This VBS is filled with incredible Bible-learning experiences kids see, hear, and touch. Team-building games, cool Bible songs, and active Bible adventures are just a few of the activities that help faith flow into real life. Your kids will also participate in outreach projects, called Projects With a Purpose, that will let the kids in our community Shine God's love to families. We hope you will join us for this life changing adventure!</div>
