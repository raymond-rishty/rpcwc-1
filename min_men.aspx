    <ol>
        <li>What encouragements or successes have you had this week?</li>
        <li>What has been the most difficult part of being the spiritual leader of your family
            lately?</li>
        <li>What needs of your wife are you focusing on meeting?</li>
        <li>Since we last met have you looked at sexually explicit material?</li>
        <li>What opportunities do you have to share your faith, for which I can be praying?</li>
        <li>What spiritual battles can I help you fight through my prayer for you?</li>
    </ol>
