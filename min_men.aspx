        Men's Weekly Breakfast</h3>
    <p>
        The Upper Room is a weekly breakfast meeting at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1147+W+Chester+Pike,+West+Chester,+PA&sll=39.970066,-75.567634&sspn=0.010146,0.016565&ie=UTF8&ll=39.969918,-75.567634&spn=0.010146,0.016565&z=16&iwloc=addr&height=300&width=300" title="West Chester Diner"  class="thickbox">West Chester Diner</a> on Route
        3, just east of Five Points Road. Based on the gathering of Jesus with His disciples
        in John 13&ndash;17, the Upper Room is a gathering of men to encourage one another
        in their walk with Christ though study, fellowship and prayer. This year's study
        is on the Pastoral Epistles, using Dr.
        Michael Ross' page-a-day devotional, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.pca-mna.org/documents/50DaysofPrayer2008.pdf" target="_blank">Men, Message &amp; Ministry</a>.&rdquo; All men
        are welcome to come at any point.</p>
