        Men's Weekly Breakfast</h3>
    <p>
        The Upper Room is a weekly breakfast meeting at the West Chester Diner on Route
        3, just east of Five Points Road. Based on the gathering of Jesus with His disciples
        in John 13&ndash;17, the Upper Room is a gathering of men to encourage one another
        in their walk with Christ though study, fellowship and prayer. This year's study
        is on the Apostles' Creed, the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Prayer, using Dr.
        Michael Ross' page-a-day devotional, &ldquo;Faith of our Fathers.&rdquo; All men
        are welcome to come at any point.</p>
    <h3>
