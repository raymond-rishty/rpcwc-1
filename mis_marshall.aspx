    <p>
        Dear Friends,</p>
    <p>
        Our time in the United States has been filled with many encouraging elements. We've
        been with many of you who keep us on the field through your prayers and giving,
        and your kindness and interest in us is so evident and of great encouragement.</p>
    <p>
        A very happy event for us was the wedding of our son Naphtali to his high school
        sweetheart, Alyssa Fowler. Alyssa spent most of her life in Ecuador where her parents
        served as missionaries. She and Naph met during the last semester of their senior
        year at the Alliance Academy in Quito, the school from which I graduated back in
        1973.</p>
    <p>
        Alyssa's parents, Mark and Laurie, had since returned from Ecuador to Bangor, Maine
        where Mark pastors the Community Church of the Open Door, and it was there that
        he and I presided over the ceremony between our two children. The presence of the
        Lord was sweet throughout it. Three of the four sets of grandparents were present,
        reflecting 52, 57, and 66 years of marriage, and a deep sense of heritage as they
        gave brief words of counsel to the newlyweds.</p>

        We invite you to visit their website at: <a href="http://www.naphandlys.com">http://www.naphandlys.com</a></p>

        They've put together a collection of pictures throughout the years along with their
        engagement story.</p>
    <h3>
        Back In Chile</h3>
    <p>
        Please continue to pray for the seminary students that I taught before coming up
        to the US. Classes varied in size from 3 to 15 with many opportunities for discussion
        and activities outside of class as well.</p>
    <p>
        All but one of the students belongs to a Presbyterian denomination that is three
        quarters neo-orthodox. As they consider their future in the denomination they must
        decide between the conservative/orthodox teaching they have received from the Brazilian
        teachers and me, and the politics of their denomination.</p>
    <p>
        These are vital months for them so please pray that they will stand strong on the
        authority of Scripture as they begin to move into their ministry. Pray specifically
        for Sebastian and Luis. Sebastian has a heart for evangelism in his church but is
        also working on an EE program that he will take to as many churches as will cooperate.
        Luis, married with four children, is under a pastor whose views he does not share.</p>
    <h3>
        Our Plans</h3>
    <p>
        Finally, pray for us as we visit supporters and seek new support. We had planned
        to return to Chile by now but the trend of our support shows the need for attention,
        and since we are due back in 2009 we decided to save the cost of the tickets and
        take our home ministry assignment now. Our return tickets are for January 6, 2009,</p>
    <h3>
