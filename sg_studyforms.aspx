        As part of the RPC Prayer Plan, all Clusters are involved in a study of prayer. The current study is <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/6281" target="_blank">A Praying Life</a> by Paul Miller.</p>

		"What a refreshing book! If you're tired of religious prayer games and rote prayers that stop at the ceiling or if you have suspected that God was on vacation somewhere, this book will change your life. And if you're thinking about giving up on prayer, don't! At least not until you've read this book. When you have, you'll thank me for recommending it to you."
