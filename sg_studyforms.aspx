            Small Group Study Forms</p>
    </h4>
    <p>
    Cluster groups are the small group ministry of RPC where we gather for fellowship, study and prayer.
    All members of RPC are encouraged to be part of a Cluster, where they are known and encouraged in the faith and able to encourage others.
    For those who want to feel more connected to fellow believers in the church, Clusters are the place.

     The study this year will be on the book of Romans, where the gospel is taught in its basics, breadth and impact. 
     We will be following a study guide found <a href="http://www.newlifeglenside.com/files/wbs/Romans1-25.pdf">here</a>
