        In thinking about the greatest need for men in our church, what stands out to me
        is for us to become men of prayer. As I've talked with guys, I discover that for
        many, if not most, their prayer lives are shallow. The upshot of which is their
        walks with Christ are superficial and the power of the Spirit in their lives is
        at a low ebb. Not to mention how this affects the home, society and the church of
        which these men are a part. &mdash; Pastor Stan Gale</p>
