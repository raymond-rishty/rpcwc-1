        The Psalms in Spiritual Warfare</h4>
    <h3>
        Psalm 36&mdash;&ldquo;The Pornographer's Prayer&rdquo;</h3>
    <div>
        &copy; 2008 by Stanley D. Gale</div>
    <br />
    <p>
        You're alone in the house. Your wife is out shopping, the kids at friends. The glow
        of the computer screen casts its eerie light in your otherwise dark den. Your search
        engine of choice waits for your bidding, your wish its command. Your fingers hover
        over the keyboard as your mind rummages through the catalog of the lusts of your
        heart. Ask, and you will receive. Finally you decide where to start. You type in
        the name of your favorite celebrity, adding the word &ldquo;naked.&rdquo; The keystroke
        &ldquo;enter&rdquo; launches your request and escorts you into a smorgasbord of
        sensuality, each site beckoning you to enter and find delight and life in its arms,
        each description enticing you with its seductive offerings. No one will know.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your palms sweaty, your heart racing, your body reacting&mdash;a twinge of conscience
        speaks to summon you back. The Spirit calls to you from Bible passages you know,
        some you've committed to memory as safeguards from the very path on which you've
        embarked. But it's too late, not actually because you have yet to click on a site,
        but virtually in that you have given yourself over to the tempter and inclined your
        ear to his appeals to the heretofore unevictable tenant of your heart&mdash;lust. The
        sultry enticements of folly have drowned out the voice of conscience. After all,
        does God not forgive? Does not the blood of Christ cleanse from all unrighteousness?
        With that reasoning, no turning back. The journey into sin comes all expenses paid.</p>
    <p>
        God's Word abounds in wisdom to equip us and help us in spiritual struggles such
        as these, all enabling us to stand firm in Christ or, having succumbed, to find
        firm footing again in Him. God makes clear his will for us as his adopted sons:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;
        that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not
        in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God; &hellip; For God has not
        called us for impurity, but in holiness.</blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: right;">
        1 Thess. 4:3&ndash;5, 7</div>
    <br />
    <p>
        Desperate for help, for escape, we cry out to our God, an ever-present help in trouble,
        a wise and loving Father to his children. One resource of divine power given us
        by our Heavenly Father who desires that we be holy as he is holy is the psalms.
        The psalms give us utterance in the face of folly, hope to buoy our spirits reeling
        from the wretchedness of our sin, truth to nourish our souls dry and weakened by
        iniquity, guidance to take our hand and lead us in the freedom that is ours in Christ
        and in the way of righteousness for his name's sake, and a way of escape in the
        hopelessness of the tightening bonds of enslavement to which we have abandoned ourselves
        first by a toe in the shallow end but now engulfed in murky water barely able to
        touch the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, read and pray through Psalm 38 and see if it does not resonate with
        the vileness of your sin, the effects of its guilt upon you, the conviction of God's
        Spirit to reclaim you, and the cry to the Lord your God for help against the spiritual
        forces of evil that lay siege to your soul.
    </p>
    <p>
        Who dirty from frolicking in the cesspool of the profane or weighed down by guilt
        from even countenancing such things cannot relate to words like these?</p>
    <blockquote>
        Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than
        snow. Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.
        Hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create in me a clean
        heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
    </blockquote>
    <div style="text-align: right;">
        Psalm 51:7&ndash;10</div>
    <br />
    <p>
        But the psalm I want to commend to you seems so expertly tailored to the misshapen
        physique of sin related to pornography that it can be titled &ldquo;The Pornographer's
        Prayer.&rdquo; I'd like us to take this psalm off the rack and walk through it together
        section-by-section to see how it fits so well. Begin by reading through the entirety
        of Psalm 36, draping it over your shoulders slumping with guilt, feeling the supple
        texture of its fabric of grace and the tight weave of truth, in fellowship with
        God who stands there to fit it to you his child.</p>
    <p>
        As you lay yourself open to your God, subject to your Lord, the Holy Spirit will
        speak though his inspired Word to your mind, heart and will to teach, rebuke, correct
        and train in righteousness. Dialog with your Heavenly Father as you consider each
        section.</p>

        Psalm 36</a>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
        1 Transgression speaks to the wicked<br />
        <span class="indent-2" />deep in his heart;<br />
        <span class="indent-1" />there is no fear of God
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />before his eyes.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&lsquo;Wicked?&rsquo; You? You're a child of God. The &lsquo;fear&rsquo; that knows, respects and honors
            God is before your eyes. But God calls us to live in a manner worthy of our calling.
            He says we must &lsquo;no longer walk as the Gentiles do&hellip;darkened in their understanding&hellip;alienated
            from the life of God&hellip;hardness of heart&hellip;given themselves up to sensuality.&rsquo; That's
            written to Christians, who &lsquo;did not learn Christ in that way.&rsquo; But when we do what
            the Gentiles do, we act as functional unbelievers, living as sons of darkness, walking
            in the flesh rather than the Spirit. A lot of ink is devoted in the epistles to
            addressing us in our functional wickedness, where we live contrary to our calling
            in Christ, and where God woos us back as our Father.</li>
        <li>Transgression, including pornography, talks. It speaks to our heart, &lsquo;deep&rsquo; in our
            heart trying to convince, cajole and capture. And, because of the sin that remains
            in us, it has an audience. The sin that remains is an ally of our enemy the devil,
            who appeals to it in his temptings. So the first step in coming before God is to
            ask: To whom will I listen? To whom will I incline my heart? Where will I direct
            our eyes?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        2 For he flatters himself in his own eyes
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />that his iniquity cannot be found out and hated.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flattery gets you nowhere&mdash;that's not true. Flattery gets us somewhere selfish. It
            makes too much of us. It breeds self-confidence, presumption and false bravado.
            We let down our guards. The seductress appeals to our male ego when she says, &lsquo;I
            have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you&hellip;let us delight
            ourselves with love.&rsquo; That's Satan talking, playing to your pride, trying to lure
            you away from Christ and ensnare you in your sin, re-labeling lust as love.</li>
        <li>Self-flattery is even worse. It not only draws us into the trap of sin as we give
            ear to the tempter, it captivates us so that we deceive ourselves into thinking
            our sin will go undiscovered or that it's not all that bad. The fact that the sin
            is common to man becomes misused as an excuse to justify or tolerate it. In self-flattery
            we allow ourselves to set the acceptable limit, but first base gets old, second
            base doesn't do it for us anymore&hellip;and before we know it we've involved to a degree
            we never thought possible, ensnared. But our God bids us to call sin &lsquo;sin&rsquo; and walk
            humbly with him, knowing our strength is found not in machismo but in meekness.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        3 The words of his mouth are trouble and deceit;
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />he has ceased to act wisely and do good.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entranced in titillations of your sordid field trip into darkness, running from
            one obscenic outlook to another, you hear a car door outside. No time to shut the
            computer down properly, no time to cover your tracks, you simply turn off the power.
            Your heart pounding through your chest, you greet your wife as she pokes her head
            in the room with as best an expression of innocence and normalcy as you can manufacture.
            What will you say? How far will you go to protect your sin? At what cost?</li>
        <li>As a child of God you are &lsquo;to act wisely and go good.&rsquo; But when you deceive you
            act in the image of the one from whose grip you have delivered, the one who stands
            opposed to God, the one whose native language is lies. Instead of protecting our
            sin God wants to us to reject it and expose it, walking in our freedom in Christ,
            that Satan might not blackmail us with exposure and so cause us to walk in fear
            and dread. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        4 He plots trouble while on his bed;
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />he sets himself in a way that is not good;
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />he does not reject evil.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have you ever lain awake plotting and working out details for your dalliances with
            death, making provision for the flesh and its lusts, generating a new wish list
            for your search engine, your heart animated by the prospect of undiscovered delights?
            Rather than setting our mind on things above where we have been raised with Christ,
            we fix our thoughts on evil. Rather than walking by the Spirit so that we will not
            carry out the deeds of the flesh, we reject God's Spirit. Instead of renouncing
            evil, fleeing from it, we pursue and warmly embrace it, even nurture it as a kept
            mistress.</li>
        <li>It's a lot easier to pull up a single weed than to deal with a lawn overgrown with
            its spread. Because the days are evil, God calls us to be alert and careful how
            we live. We want to make provision for that which is good and noble and wholesome
            and holy, setting our faces toward good not evil, toward God not the evil one. That
            begs the question: What seeds are you planting in your mind that will take root
            in your heart and bear fruit in your life?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        5 Your steadfast love, O LORD, extends to the heavens,
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />your faithfulness to the clouds.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Now the psalmist shows us what real love looks like, not the wolf of lust dressed
            up in love&rsquo;s clothing. He directs our attention to a vast, boundless love. Even
            if our sin reaches to the sky, God's steadfast love reflected in his amazing grace
            to us towers over it, reaching to the heavens, not an excuse for sin but a reason
            for pursuit of purity. </li>
        <li>Rather than cover up your sin through covering your tracks, excusing it, minimizing
            it or any other bandage provided by the infirmary of the evil one, God's love in
            Christ invites you to uncover it that he might cover it in the forgiveness and righteousness
            of his provision of love. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        6 Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />your judgments are like the great deep;
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />man and beast you save, O LORD.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Here we are messing around with sin, walking in functional wickedness, living like
            sons of darkness and disobedience and what does the psalmist point us to? He reminds
            us of our God and his character. He is a righteous God. He desires truth and purity
            in our inner being and obedience from the bottom of our heart. We're to seek first
            his kingdom and his righteousness. In fact, righteousness is a family trait he wants
            us to pursue. </li>
        <li>God reminds us where his justice is satisfied and his righteousness is found. That's
            what the gospel is all about. God knows we're sinners prone to wander, prone to
            leave the God we love and he tells us we need to leave Satan's bed and return to
            him through confession and repentance. Real repentance aims for a changed life,
            and life of righteousness. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        7 How precious is your steadfast love, O God!
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />The children of mankind take refuge in the shadow of your
        wings.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If your house was on fire and you could escape with only one thing, what would it
            be? Now you know what's &lsquo;precious&rsquo; to you. Precious is not a very masculine word
            but it is a diagnostic word. It detects what you love, to what you ascribe great
            value. Jesus is precious to the Father. You are precious to the Father, beloved
            of God. </li>
        <li>Now comes the glare of the Spirit's spotlight. What is precious to you? What do
            find yourself delighting in? Whose embrace do you desire? Whose breasts satisfy
            you? That's a biblical image not only for faithfulness to your wife, but for faithfulness
            to your God against the seductions of Satan.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        8 They feast on the abundance of your house,
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />and you give them drink from the river of your delights.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Judging by your heart rate, pornography makes you more alive, makes life fuller
            and more exciting. That's kind of like getting high, isn't it? Yet, the euphoria
            is nothing but a lie, a mirage, a deception. When you come down from your binging
            you find yourself empty, hollow, dirty, defiled, weak, withered and self-loathing.
            And like addiction to a drug, you get your fix and say &lsquo;That's it; no more.&rsquo; But
            there's always the craving for the bottomless pit of &lsquo;just one more time,&rsquo; as you
            seek to restore the alleged &lsquo;bliss,&rsquo; the &lsquo;blessedness&rsquo; of Belial. </li>
        <li>God, however, tells you of what will really satisfy you, what brings genuine, sustained
            delight, an abundance of blessing. It all has to do with Jesus, with knowing him,
            loving him, seeking him, serving him. As guys, we're big on junk food. Talk about
            the ultimate junk food! Actually, pornography is death food, poisoning us as it
            separates us from abiding in Christ as the Vine of life. And in our foolishness
            we gorge ourselves with it, while God's banquet of blessing stands in his goodness
            and steadfast love spread before us in the presence of our enemies. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        9 For with you is the fountain of life;
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />in your light do we see light.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>In Christ, God's face shines upon us and brings us peace. Pornography acts to eclipse
            the light of God's face. Just like with the eclipse of the sun, the light is still
            there. But we can't see it, nor can we walk by it. Our heart grows cold without
            it. God calls us from the abusive and debilitating slave driver of pornography to
            the beauty and grace of the light and life of our God. </li>
        <li>God's light is our light&mdash;the light of his love, the light of his kingdom into which
            he has brought us, the light of his word that directs our steps in a world filled
            with perils and pitfalls. Just as we find the shadow of protection in God's presence,
            so we find the light of direction in his hand. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        10 Oh, continue your steadfast love to those who know you,
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />and your righteousness to the upright of heart!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>This prayer is kind of like asking the sun to keep shining. It does shine and it
            will shine. But when you climb out of the cesspool of pornography, when you turn
            back to God from your dalliance with the adulteress of Abaddon, that's a natural
            fear. Has God taken his love from me? Has he had enough of my philandering? God
            reminds you that he set his love on you while you were a sinner. His love came to
            you in the first place while you were in arms of Satan. You know him because he
            first knew you. And if God has truly captured you with his love, nothing will be
            able to separate you from that love for you in Jesus&mdash;not your sin, not Satan, not
            anything. </li>
        <li>Notice, though, what the psalmist calls you. He calls you &lsquo;upright of heart.&rsquo; That's
            how God sees you in Christ, clothed with a righteousness not your own. And because
            that is your status in Christ, that's also your goal. You are to live in light,
            in freedom, in obedience as a son. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        11 Let not the foot of arrogance come upon me,
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
        <br />
        12 There the evildoers lie fallen;
        <br />
        <span class="indent-2" />they are thrust down, unable to rise.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As manly as you think you are, you're not strong enough to deal with the sin of
            your life. Lest sin overtake you, lest Satan overcome you, you need to be strong
            in the Lord and in the power of his might. God is your refuge and strength. You
            can do all things through Christ who gives you strength. Apart from him you can
            do nothing. Do you get the idea? We're back to the principle of conducting spiritual
            warfare in weakness, ours that is, so that we might find our victory and our strength
            to deal with Satan's temptations in Christ. Only in Christ can you master sin.
        </li>
        <li>The devil is a liar and the father of lies. He is the ultimate scam artist. But
            his plans will perish. He will be cast down. With that in mind, God calls you to
            walk in the way that will bring blessing not curse, life not death, feast not famine,
            delight not despair, fruitfulness not barrenness, that you might know the abundant
            life to which your Lord Jesus has brought you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The divine Couturier expertly tailors this psalm to the physique of the sin of pornography
        and to whatever personal and particular dimensions your sin has now or could ever
        take. As you don the whole armor of God to take your stand against the seducer of
        your soul, the adulteress for your affections, firmly ensconce yourself in the strong
        arms of your Savior, Jesus Christ, whose love for you is real and proven and relentless
        and everlasting.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before
        the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus
        Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and
        now and forever. Amen.
