        Dear Praying Friends,
    </p>
    
    <p>
        God continues to add more people to our fellowship, for which we are extremely
        grateful. Moreover, the Lord has been at work in the men of our congregation as
        we learn and commune together in being disciples of Jesus. Pray for us as we (about
        7 men) meet on Saturday mornings for life-on-life discipleship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pray also...
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Sunday, October 19th launch/celebration worship service</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        On this Sunday we will be holding a special service in which we will invite many
        people in our community with a view of praying for our community and city. The
        preparation requires attention to many details for which we ask our Father's blessings.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Sunday afternoon, the 12th, we plan on distributing 3,000 flyers. Please
        pray for good weather...Hurricane Norbert in the Pacific Ocean is threatening
        to bring us rain. We certainly want the rain here in the desert, but would ask
        God to bring it another afternoon!
    </p>
    <p>
        Please pray for God's blessing on the preaching of the gospel, the music and singing
        (which is one of our weaknesses!), but above all for Him to be glorified and his
        Kingdom extended.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Vaughn Family</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Jeff, Heather and their four children arrived about 3 weeks ago. As you may recall,
        Jeff, an ordained minister will be working with us at Las Tierras for a couple
        of years. After this he will probably be sent to work in another area of the border.=20
    </p>
    <p>
        Please pray for the Lord to help them settle in and adjust to border life, and
        for God to encourage and give them opportunities to use and test their gifts.
        Pray for me as I have the privilege and responsibility of mentoring Jeff.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pray also for the Lord's protection and provision for them. In the short time
        they have been here they have had car and computer problems, sicknesses and accidents
        (their 2 yr old fell off a bunk bed- which he should not have been on- and was
        blessed with 14 stitches!).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Praise for a great Block Party</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for praying for the Lord's blessing on the block party. It was a perfect
        evening in which neighbors who rarely see each other spent hours getting re-acquainted.
        Please ask God to grant us favor with our neighbors especially as we invite them
        to our special service on the 19th.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>4. Health and Safety Fair</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        On October 25, the Las Tierras Neighborhood Association (of which I am their fearless
        leader!) will be co-hosting, along with the new hospital, a Health Safety Fair
        in our community. As a church we are supporting and helping organize this event.
        Please ask the Lord's blessing as folks come for various health screenings.
    </p>
    <p>
        As always, thank you for your faithful prayer and financial support.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the King,
    </p>
    <p>
