        Tito and Kim Padilla (Tex-Mex border, MNA)</h4>
    <p>
        Dear Friend in Christ,</p>
    <p>
        Great is our God, and gracious and kind are his dealings with us! During this past
        month we have been abundantly blessed, and so we want to give him the glory!</p>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Sports Camp, 2008</strong></p>
    <p>
        Thank you for praying diligently for this outreach into the community. Praise God
        because all went very well this year. We had just about<strong> 80 kids and about 20
            coaches/assistants and other helpers. </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The kids enjoyed themselves tremendously, and hopefully improved their skills in
        the different sports they played. God graciously provided the exact volunteers needed
        through Las Tierras church members, neighbors and a group from Village 7 Church
        in Colorado Springs. The City of El Paso provided a soccer coach (former professional
        player in Mexico). However, he twisted his ankle mid-week. Please pray for God to
        <strong>bring healing to Coach Alex</strong>.</p>
    <p>
        We have already had one family from the Sports Camp visit us at church. Please pray
        for the <strong>Lord to direct the Gonzalez family</strong> back to us if that is
        his good purpose. Pray that other families would visit and that Las Tierras Church&#39;s
        love for and service to the community would continue to open many doors of opportunity.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Facility Use</strong></p>
    <p>
        Praise God that the school district <strong>approved our use of the school band</strong>
        room for our Sunday worship services for another year!</p>
    <p>
        <strong>3. Montana Vista Project, Peña Home</strong></p>
    <p>
        The construction of the Peña home is going great! God is providing every step of
        the way through unexpected people and gifts! To all of you who continue to pray
        and who have given, a <strong>heart-felt thanks</strong>! Folks from Village Seven
        Church not only helped at the Sports Camp, but they also served by putting the roof
        and (most of the) shingles. They labored tirelessly under the El Paso sun with temperatures
        around 105-107 degrees daily. God preserved and strengthened us for the task.</p>
    <p>
        Last week a few of us framed the interior walls of the house and just yesterday
        we put the windows and doors in place.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will soon have 66% of the funding needed to complete the house. We are hoping
        to <strong>complete the house by the first week of August. If you (and/or your church)
            are able to give any size gift, we would be most grateful.</strong> Please pray
        for God to provide the balance of the monies needed...about <strong>$10,000 more</strong>.
        Pray for God to bless the teams that are coming throughout the month of July to
        work on the house. Ask God to mercifully protect and strengthen them so that they
        may serve with great joy and out of love for Jesus.</p>
    <p>
        The Peña family continues to worship with us and needless to say, are thrilled with
        the progress of their house. (<strong>See the attached picture of the house!)</strong>
        The day that Alma Peña (the mom) saw the roof on her house, the daughter Brenda
        told me of how her mom screamed with excitement, and then cried with joy. <strong>What
            a glorious picture of our response when we see our future everlasting home...our
            mansion in heaven!</strong></p>
    <p>
        Peace in the Great Provider,</p>
    <p>
        Manuel "Tito" Padilla</p>
