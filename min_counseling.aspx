<h3>
		Counseling Ministry</h3>
    <br />
	<h4>
		Vision of the RPC Counseling Ministry</h4>
	<p>
		The RPC Counseling Ministry seeks to offer Biblically based, Christ centered counseling, addressing many common issues of life, involving individual counseling, group sessions, training, and education.   Our counseling looks to reach to the heart, not just change in outward behavior, seeking Christ for transformation, not just temporary fixes.</p>

	<h4>
		Ministry Partnership</h4>
	<p>
		In addition to having counselors from RPC, we have formed a Ministry Partnership with the Life Enrichment Christian Counseling Center (LECCC).  The staff at LECCC consists of Biblically trained counselors who are deeply committed to help you see and apply God’s solutions to your difficult and painful problems.</p>

	<h4>
		Fees/Donations to Ministry</h4>
	<p>
		Fees are charged or donations requested on a case by case basis.</p>

	<h4>
		What is expected from the Counselee</h4>
	<p>
		Our belief is that change must begin with ourselves as we look to Christ for His wisdom and power.  Therefore, we ask you to approach the counseling process as an opportunity for personal change and spiritual growth.  We ask that you refrain from the temptation to focus on others, and instead focus on what changes God desires to make in your life, in the midst of your circumstances.  Above all, bring yourself to the God who is at work in your situation and who is able to do beyond what we expect or even imagine.</p>
