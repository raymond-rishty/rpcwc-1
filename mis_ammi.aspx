        Ron and Jackie Elkin, <a href="http://www.ammiministry.org/">AMMI Ministry</a></h4>
    <p>
        Dear brothers and sisters in God's Family, 10/9/08 YOM KIPPUR 10/8 TO 10/9 Last
        night the Jewish observance of Yom Kippur / The Day of Atonement began (read Lev.
        16). Religious Jewish people began fasting at sundown and will end the fast today
        at sundown. During the synagogue service the shofar / ram's horn will be sounded
        to remind the people of the call to repentance. They also corporately and individually
        confess their sins. It is their home that through fasting and confession of sins,
        God will forgive them and bless their lives for the coming year. Ultra Orthodox
        Chasidic Jews may sacrifice a chicken and swing it over the heard of their children
        and themselves while they confess their sins. They recognize the need for blood
        atonement but not the fulfillment of this through Jesus.
    </p>
    <h3>
        PLEASE PRAY:
    </h3>
    <p>
        That the Holy Spirit of God would convict Jewish hearts around the world during
        this time of sin, righteousness and judgment, and in kindness lead them to repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
        That in that kindness would be revelation that it is impossible to atone for our
        own sin and to be made righteous by our own efforts, that there would be revelation
        about the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        That there would be revelation about the Blood of Messiah—that the blood of bulls
        and goats in the past, or of a chicken today, is not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Israel's protection from her enemies during this day. Exactly 35 years ago she
        was attacked by Egypt and Syria while most of the nation was in the synagogues.
    </p>
    <h3>
        WITNESSING: TO THE GENTILES FIRST AND ALSO THE JEWS?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Paul wrote in Romans 1:16 &ldquo;I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the
        power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then
        for the Gentile.&rdquo; Of course God is in charge and sometimes he reverses the
        order. On Sept 29, David Jones and I visited an ESL students name Zhenya and his
        wife Tatiana. They are from a city in Belarus that is only 14 miles from the Polish
        border. They were raised in the Russian Orthodox Church, and attend a Russian Orthodox
        Church near their apartment in the Philadelphia area.
    </p>
    <p>
        I asked a few diagnostic questions and it became clear that neither of them understood
        the grace that Jesus obtained for us by his saving atonement. They were depending
        on their own goodness and good deeds to be accepted by God. However, they were open
        to discuss Jesus. While Dave interpreted what I said into Russian, I explained the
        wonderful forgives that Jesus bought for us with his precious blood. We spoke for
        several hours. I used different illustrations to explain grace, and we read verses
        of Scriptures. At the end of our discussion this young couple stood (the Russian
        Orthodox way of praying) and confessed and repented of their sins, and put their
        trust in Jesus. Dave and I plan to help them grow in their new spiritual life.
    </p>
    <h3>
        AND TO THE JEWS
    </h3>
    <p>
        I met a Russian Jewish husband and wife who are also from Belarus. Their names are
        Mark and Bella. Mark is doing electrical work in out home, and Bella is assisting
        him. Mark and I have hit it off and he is open to discussing the Gospel. Bella is
        also friendly and has met some Jewish Christians in Philadelphia. Because Bella's
        help isn't always needed, she began to read some of the literature I had available.
        She found a Russian book that she is devouring. The book gives the testimony of
        a Jewish European man who explains how he came to believe in Jesus prior to World
        War II. I also gave her a booklet called &ldquo;Ultimate Questions&rdquo; by John
        Blanchard. This very useful booklet gives a summary of Biblical teachings regarding
        God and man's sin dilemma and mankind's purpose. Pray that God will continue to
        bless our contact with this family and Mark and Bella will believe in Jesus .

        $$ FINANCIAL UPDATE $$ In my previous updates I mentioned our financial burden from
        recent expenses. Several donors have provided special gifts that have reduced our
        need to $1,4230. If you would like to help us further reduce our financial need,
        you can send a check to the address below or make an online donation at AMMI's website
        also listed below.

    <p>
        Shalom in Jesus,
