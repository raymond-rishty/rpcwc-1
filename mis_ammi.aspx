    <h4>
        Ron and Jackie Elkin, <a href="http://www.ammiministry.org/">AMMI Ministry</a></h4>
    <p>
        Dear brothers and sisters,</p>
    <h3>
        Subscription offer leads to several witness opportunities with an Israeli</h3>
    <p>
        I received a call from "Roy" a subscription salesman from Jerusalem Post International
        Edition. Roy is based in Tel Aviv, Israel. He wanted to sell me a subscription to
        the Post. During the conversation the Lord opened the door for a Gospel witness.
        I shared my testimony and also explained the Gospel from an O.T. perspective. He
        listened and promised to look up the New Covenant promise in Jeremiah 31:31-34.</p>
    <p>
        About a month later I received a call from Roy and we discussed the Jeremiah passage,
        which he had read, Praise the Lord! He continues to be open and was willing to listen
        and discuss the Gospel for over 20 minutes. We plan to communicate more through
        e-mail. Pray God will continue our dialogue and that God will bring Israeli Christians
        into his life.</p>
    <h3>
        Witnessing on the Go</h3>
    <p>
        I am always amazed how God arranges divine appointments to give a witness for Jesus.
        In early June, Jackie and I went to Dallas, TX to the Presbyterian Church American's
        General Assembly (GA) to represent AMMI Ministry. We had a display and an opportunity
        to speak to many pastors and elders about the needs of the Jewish people to hear
        the Gospel. I am still following up on these new contacts and hope in time it will
        lead to opportunities to teach our new Jewish Evangelism Seminar and to preach God's
        Word.</p>
    <p>
        A gracious family in Plano, TX allowed us to live in their home, lent us their car,
        and arranged for another believer to pick us up at the airport and return us to
        the airport later in the week. The host family left for New York the day before
        we arrived so Jackie and I had a wonderful home all to ourselves. God's provision
        is amazing.</p>
    <p>
        Near the home that we stayed at in Dallas, there was a supermarket where I shopped
        for food. When I paid for the food the check out clerk was Sima, a Russian Jewish
        woman from Ukraine. It turns out there is a small Russian Jewish population among
        the 56,000 Jewish people who live in the Dallas area. Later I was able to give Sima
        the Russian version of the "Ultimate Questions" booklet by John Blanchard. Pray
        that God will touch her heart. I also included with the booklet my testimony and
        contact information.</p>
    <p>
        In the same shopping center where the supermarket is located Jackie and I discovered
        a newly open Mediterranean style restaurant called Los Rios. The restaurant is owned
        and operated by two Muslim men from Lebanon who have lived in the USA for many years.
        Their names are Nahid and Hamid. The food was delicious and healthy, and because
        the restaurant was newly opened and not busy we had the opportunity to talk to the
        men. I shared the Gospel with Hamid and developed a friendship with both men. When
        I returned to Philadelphia, I had Multi-Language Media in Ephrata, PA send the men
        three different Arabic books, This literature explains the Gospel from a Muslim
        perspective. The owners also gave me their personal contact information. I will
        be calling them to further our friendship and witness. I am also encouraging believers
        in the Plano area to stop in and continue the witness while they enjoy an inexpensive
        but good meal.</p>
    <p>
        The GA was held in a hotel near downtown Dallas. While there Jackie and I took several
        meals at the hotel's café and salad bar. This opened the door for two more witnessing
        opportunity. Our waiter several times was Abdul, a Muslim man from Bangladesh. He
        has lived here for many years and had a God centered focus on life. We had many
        enjoyable conversations, and (we ate in the café at a slow time) Abdul expressed
        his concern over the moral decline of the American society. He has great concern
        for his children and is doing his best to influence them to follow a moral path.
        Jackie and I witnessed the Gospel to the man and I gave him the Ultimate Questions
        booklet. Later I sent him a Bengali Bible and the Jesus Video in the Bengali language.
        I am searching for Arabic speaking and American Christians in the Dallas area to
        follow up on these three Muslim contacts.</p>
    <p>
        At one of our meals, our waitress was named Maria. Maria is searching for God and
        very concerned that her fourteen year old grandson doesn't fall into the evil of
        this world. As we witnessed to her, she explained her difficulty in understanding
        the Bible and that she needed a Spanish version. At a neighboring table a representative
        from a book company that had a display at the GA overheard our conversation. He
        encouraged me to stop by their display and they would give me a Bible for Maria.
        They gave me a beautiful Spanish-English Bible and Maria was thrilled to receive
        it. Later I sent her additional books including a Bible dictionary. Rev. Josh Geiger
        who is planting a Hispanic church in Dallas is following up on Maria.</p>
    <h3>
        Bridging with my Jewish Relative</h3>
    <p>
        All of my Jewish relatives avoid me like a plague because of my faith in Jesus.
        However, I recently had the opportunity to re-establish a friendship with a second
        cousin named Phyllis. Phyllis had lunch with us last week. She remembered me as
        a rebellious young man, and during her visit to our home, she told me several times
        she was very impressed with the way my life has turned out.</p>
    <p>
        She asked me why I believed in Jesus. This gave me a great opportunity to explain
        my salvation story and the Gospel. We plan to meet again and put together a family
        tree. Pray for God to continue to bless this opportunity to connect with family
        and to give a witness for the Lord.</p>
    <h3>
        Ask and You Shall Find</h3>
    <p>
        If you're not regularly witnessing to people as you go about your life, pray for
        God to change that. In Jesus we are blessed with eternal life. While on this earth,
        God tells us in 1st Peter 2:9-10; "9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
        a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him
        who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. 10 Once you were not a
        people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but
        now you have received mercy." We are called to tell others about the wonderful grace
        available in Jesus. Pray for divine appointments in you daily life.</p>
    <p>
        This week we are joining another ministry that is visiting the area to do street
        evangelism. I will be on the streets of downtown Philadelphia and then giving my
        testimony to the witnessing team. Pray for God to give us divine appointments.</p>
