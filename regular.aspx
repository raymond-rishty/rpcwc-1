    <h3>
            SUNDAY SERVICE OF WORSHIP
    </h3>
    <p>
        We gather together for corporate worship of our triune God on the Lord's Day. Our
        service features preaching from the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, private
        and corporate prayer, and theologically sound music reflecting covenantal diversity
        across generations. We pursue worship that is God-directed, Christ-centered and
        Spirit-enabled. The Lord's Supper is ordinarily observed the first Sunday of each
        month.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>
        Children ages 2 through fifth grade are ministered to in a special way during the
        worship service on Sunday mornings to make the time more meaningful and to train
        them in worship. Children ages 2&ndash;4 will meet separately for the entire service for
        supervised play time, a Bible lesson and activities. Children age 5 through 5th
        grade will worship with their families and be dismissed at the sermon for teaching
        and crafts. Once a month this older group will meet in the balcony area for instruction
        in worship using a special childrens bulletin called <em>RPC Junior Jots &amp; Tittles</em>
        prepared by Pastor Gale specifically for that week.
