    <h3>
        SUNDAY SERVICE OF WORSHIP
    </h3>
    <p>
        We gather together for corporate worship of our triune God on the Lord's Day. Our
        service features preaching from the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, private
        and corporate prayer, and theologically sound music reflecting covenantal diversity
        across generations. We pursue worship that is God-directed, Christ-centered and
        Spirit-enabled. The Lord's Supper is ordinarily observed the first Sunday of each
        month.</p>

        MONTHLY PRAYER CONVOCATIONS</h3>

        Believing that prayer is vital to the health and growth of its members and the effectiveness
        of its ministry, an emphasis on prayer pervades all parts of the life of RPC. One
        facet of that emphasis is a monthly gathering in corporate prayer for communion
        with God and seeking His care.</p>
