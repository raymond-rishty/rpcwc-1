        <h3>50 Days of Prayer</h3>
        <p>Dear Saints in the Lord,</p>

<p>Today is the National Day of Prayer.  I encourage you to spend time in prayer for our nation, and particularly for the church to be salt and light and influence for Christ in our nation.</p>

<p>Today also begins 50 Days of Prayer for our denomination, the Presbyterian Church in America.  I ask that you download the devotional to your desktop (<a href="http://www.pca-mna.org/fiftydaysofprayer.php">www.pca-mna.org/fiftydaysofprayer.php</a>) and spend each day reading the devotion and praying.
 Be sure to read Mike's Ross' Introduction. I think you'll find it thought-provoking.  And be sure to pray and not just read the devotional. After all, it is 50 days of PRAYER.
 As we've seen in our series through the book of Ephesians and we will see particularly this Sunday as we look at the benediction for Christ's church, we must be faithful and urgent in prayer.</p>

<p>In the name of Him who intercedes for us.</p>
<p>Pastor Gale</p>
