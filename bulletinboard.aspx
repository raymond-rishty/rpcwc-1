        <u>Two women are graduating from our parenting class and each will need a crib and mattress</u>
        to put their new little baby in. All cribs and mattresses must be new due to insurance
        liability regulations. You can provide a crib and mattress by either purchasing
        the set and bringing it to our Coatesville location or by providing the funds for
        a new set and we'll purchase the set for you (approximate cost is $200 per set).</p>
