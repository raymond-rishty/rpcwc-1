        Our West Chester office has two available apartments for rent and we are struggling
        to find tenants. Both apartments are located in the beautiful historic district
        within the borough of West Chester. Within a short walking distance you are at West
        Chester University, various restaurants, shopping, parks, public transportation,
        and more! The 100 year old building offers the charm of yesteryear and the convenience
        of today! Here are the details for each apartment:</p>
    <p>
        Second Floor Rear Apartment: This studio apartment has been recently renovated and
        includes a walk in closet and a separate brand new kitchen! Included in the rent
        price is heat, electric, hot and cold water and trash removal. We all know parking
        is a problem in West Chester...guess what? This apartment includes a parking space!!
        All for just $725 per month!!</p>
    <p>
        Second Floor Front Apartment: This one bedroom apartment offers space that makes
        it possible for two people to share. Included in the price is heat, hot and cold
        water, and trash removal. Again...parking is included in the rent price of just
        $875 per month!!

        This is a smoke free/ pet free building that includes hardwood floors! If you know
        anyone that is looking for a great location to live...have them contact us right
        away. First come, first serve.... You just might be the person that either needs
        or knows someone that needs one of these apartments! You can bless the ministry
        of CCWS and we can bless tenants with these two apartments. Please spread the word!
