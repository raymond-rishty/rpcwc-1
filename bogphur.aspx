        Dear praying friends,</p>
    <p>
        This is exam time in India. All 10th class (grade) students and 12th must go to
        an exam center for each subject for the &ldquo;board exams&rdquo;. Nothing, I mean
        <strong>nothing</strong> (even church and Sunday School sometimes), takes precedence
        over the students' (and the mothers') time during the weeks when they are preparing
        for these exams, even the tests in the lower classes that are held in the school.
        The feeling is that their whole future lies in the results. And, of course, to a
        certain degree, that is true in this system, if you are thinking only in terms of
        education and careers.
    </p>
    <p>
        So at Grace Academy too the tension is high at this season, though being a Christian
        school we keep reminding each other and the students that man does not live by bread
        alone or by exams alone! The 85 hostel (or residential) students (those in boarding
        in the two dormitories on campus) never miss church and Sunday School on the exam
        excuse and are still encouraged to do their studying on other days rather than on
        Sunday. Of course during this month the churches pray faithfully for their students.</p>
    <p>
        As a board member I was asked to pray with (and say a few words to) the 12th class
        students who were going for the first exam, chemistry, early one morning. I was
        picked up by the school jeep (though Grace Academy is only a 7 minute walk from
        our house and I usually prefer to walk) and was ushered to the room where the chemistry
        teacher was giving last minute tips. I reminded them that what their minds AND HEARTS
        had learned in these years (a few of them I have known since they were really little)
        cannot be taken from them and will benefit them for their whole lives, no matter
        what happens at the exams. And then I prayed fervently that the Lord would calm
        their beating hearts and clear their minds to remember what they had learned; also
        that the exams and examiners would be fair. Students did come back believing that
        was the case.</p>
    <p>
        When it was time for them to leave in the school bus I took a picture or two. To
        my surprise, the principal and vice principal both jumped into the bus with them
        as it was driving off. No doubt they would return after they had delivered them
        to the exam center and had said a few final words of encouragement.</p>
    <p>
        Several of these 12th class students have been in the hostel (in boarding at the
        School) for a number of years. Their parents are out in the Indian missionary movement
        serving the Lord in places here in North India where local Christian English education
        is not available. A number of these students, from grades 2 to 12, are at present
        in need of scholarship. A monthly sum of $45 would help their parents pay most of
        their fees for living in the boarding. Most of the Indian Christian workers and
        missionaries are not paid well enough to be able to afford these fees.<br />

    <strong>PLEASE THANK THE LORD WITH US FOR</strong>:
    <p>
        <em>SPRING WEATHER</em>: Our spring comes earlier here than in the U.S. and we are
        so thankful. This year it seems to have warmed up even more quickly than usual.
        The flowers are beautiful: roses, nasturtiums, carnations, geraniums, periwinkle
        and gladiolas; even marigolds and poinsettias are still blooming. And a great variety
        of birds are joining us in praising the Lord.</p>
    <p>
        <em>HEALTH</em>: We are all enjoying the good health and are in good spirits.</p>
    <p>
        <em>SOME THINGS ARE GETTING EASIER</em>: We still have our stories of endless hassles
        and red tape that this land is famous for. But some things are getting easier. For
        instance, now packages of used clothing and shoes for the Bhogpur Homes are getting
        through safely and without any duty (if marked used and not given value or insured).
        Several of you have already tested that and it has proven true. Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>ALL OF YOU</em>: How we praise the Lord for all of you who have been so generous
        in your prayers, financial resources and other things, such as the used clothes.
        Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>COVENANT CHURCH</em>: In this past month a number of people confirmed new faith
        in the appropriate way. It is a slow process, but the work goes on. In Passion Week
        there will be services each evening Monday through Thursday and a morning service
        Friday morning as well as services on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>PLEASE PRAY WITH US</strong>:</p>
    <p>
        GRACE ACADEMY AND HOSTEL:</p>
    <p>
        That all students will do well in their exams and determine to work even harder
        on their studies next term.</p>
    <p>
        That funds for the new classroom building and for students in the hostel needing
        scholarship will come in soon.</p>
    <p>
        For new staff, especially house parents in the hostels, for the next term; people
        who love the Lord and understand or will quickly learn the concepts of Christian
        education.</p>
    <p>
        VALLEY BIBLE FELLOWSHIP:</p>
    <p>
        For some person or persons to live in Phil's and Amina's house when they go on HMA
        in June; someone who will allow and even contribute to the Friday evening Bible
        studies that are being held there. The Sunday services are held
        <br />
        at a hotel, but it is best to have the Bible study in a home in that area.</p>
    <p>
        CHILDREN'S HOMES:
    </p>
    <p>
        At Home Academy at the Bhogpur Children's Home students are taking these exams also.
        Please join us in praying for them as well.</p>
    <p>
        Notice that Grace Academy, featured on the first page, is a completely separate
        institution from the Bhogpur Homes and
        <br />
        Home Academy. David was the &ldquo;founding principal&rdquo; of both schools and
        we are still involved in both. It sometimes becomes confusing for people.</p>
    <p>
        Last month we asked you to pray for revival in the Homes and in the church in Bhogpur.
        I visited over Sunday last week and was encouraged by some things that have happened
        recently. But there is still much need for prayer for the Lord's working in all
        of our institutions and hearts. Please continue to ask the Lord for conviction of
        sin, repentance and spiritual renewal for all of us over here.</p>
    <p>
        There is an excellent DVD on the Bhogpur Home made by the Robinsons of Richmond,
        VA. They visited last summer, took video and are now representing the Homes personally
        and through the video. We highly recommend it. Ask for the Robinsons' DVD on the
        India Bhogpur Children's Home.</p>
    <p>
        In Christ,
    </p>

    <p>
        MTW has passed on to me your request for information about the financial situation
        at the Bhogpur Children's Homes. We very much appreciate the concern of your church
        for the Homes, your prayers, and the gifts you have sent in the past months. Since
        the three homes and approximately 800 children lost the support of the large funding
        agency rather suddenly in November, 2006, the Lord has been providing for them in
        a wonderful way through God's people; friends like your church. No child has had
        to be sent away and a limited number of new children have been taken in. We plan
        to take in a larger number this month.</p>
    <p>
        Some children, of course, have graduated from high school and finished their college
        or training and a few children have been taken out by their parents for various
        reasons. That is something that does happen from time to time. At present there
        are 667 children enrolled who are well taken care of physically, under the daily
        hearing of the Word of God and studying in various schools. We do pray that funds
        will be sufficient soon for us to be able to take in as many children each year
        as graduate, which has not been possible since 2006</p>
    <p>
        It takes around $26,000 a month to maintain the Homes (that is not counting special
        projects like painting and repairing the buildings, replacing of vehicles and major
        equipment, etc.). At present we have enough balance at MTW for 4 or 5 months ahead.
        That is the way it has been all along as the Lord moves people like your church
        to give. We look to the Lord to continue to provide these funds. Please pray with
        us.</p>
