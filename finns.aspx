        Metro Philadelphia Church Planting Partnership</h3>

        <b>"Saturating Metro Philadelphia, South Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania with the Gospel
            and Gospel-Centered Churches"</b></p>
    <p>
        Dear partners in church planting:</p>
    <p>
        Two roads, two countries. Canada, the United States. British Columbia, Washington
        state.</p>
    <p>
        Early in April I crossed this border to take a look at an Assessment Center where
        church planters are evaluated alongside key lay leaders through the ministry of
        Grace Vancouver in Western Canada. My purpose was to discover whether this is a
        form of assessment that we might want to reproduce in metro Philadelphia. I expected
        to be an observer, a &ldquo;fly on the wall&rdquo; who watches the process from
        a distance. (Canadians say, &ldquo;prOcess&rdquo; with a long &ldquo;o&rdquo;) Upon
        my arrival, however, I was invited to be a fullfledged assessor.</p>
    <p>
        The scenery of British Columbia was awesome. The city of Vancouver is stunning against
        the background of the mountains. And the assessment of church planters and key lay
        leaders was impressive. The process includes the typical evaluations of character,
        calling and ministry competency that are always a part of the planters-only assessment
        which is usually done in Atlanta. But the Vancouver version allows the assessors
        to see how prospective church planters interact with gifted lay leaders in the context
        of strategic vision-casting and ministry development. And the lay leaders benefit
        from an evaluation of their gifts, passions and experience in ways that guide them
        to more effective involvement in ministry. My conclusion is that these parallel
        roads of assessment present a model that should be replicated in our Partnership
        for Philadelphia.</p>
    <p>
        Traveling across borders helps me keep my missionary senses sharp and it reminds
        me that our mission to the United States is a small part of God’s greater mission
        to the world.</p>
    <p>
        For the third summer in a row I will have the privilege of leading a team from my
        local congregation, Covenant Church in Doylestown, on a week-long mission to Casa
        Hogar orphanage in Acapulco, Mexico. Toward the end of April I made a brief visit
        to Mexico to prepare for the trip and get oriented to the work that the team will
        do there this summer.</p>
    <p>
        In this brief time I was reminded of why I love these previous children and why
        I love to lead our team to Mexico. And my passion for reaching people in metro Philly
        is reignited.</p>
    <p>
        Moving day is fast approach for several of our newest church planters. Though Jim
        Powell will not change his residence, in June he will shift his ministry focus away
        from Cornerstone Church in Coopersburg, PA to the western edge of the Lehigh Valley
        to plant West Valley Church in Lower Macungie. You can track Jim’s progress and
        read his reflections on his blog at: <a href="http://weakchristian.wordpress.com/">http://weakchristian.wordpress.com/</a>.
        Also in June Dave Baggett will move with his family to the eastern edge of Delaware
        County, just south of the city, to start his work on a new church near Clifton Heights.
        In the past decade the Route 1/Instate 95 corridor has transitioned into one of
        the most ethnically diverse areas of the near suburbs, offering many challenges
        to Dave as he begins his mission.</p>
    <p>
        In the meantime, two prospective church planters are working out the details on
        proposals to plant churches in Mullica Hill and Atlantic City. (I have withheld
        their names, for now, until their plans become more certain.) If all goes well,
        these two men will be preparing their families soon to move on to the harvest fields.</p>
    <p>
        In the past couple of weeks I have had significant conversations with four other
        men who are seriously considering church planting somewhere in our partnership.
        I am impressed by how deeply each man struggles to understand God’s will and by
        their respect for the complexity, risk and need for new Gospel-centered churches
        in Philadelphia, south Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p>
        Debbie and I are pleased to announce that our oldest daughter Kelly will marry Oliver
        Störmer on January 17, 2009 at Tenth Church in Philadelphia. Both will complete
        their commitments to the U.S. Navy by year’s end. Oliver is in training as a pilot
        for Continental Airlines. Kelly will receive a Master of Business Administration
        from George Washington University in December. They plan to live in New York City
        after the wedding.</p>

    <h4>
        News from the four presbyteries in the Partnership:</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Eastern Pennsylvania</b> &mdash; As our Church Planting Partnership and the presbytery
        reach their 3rd anniversaries on July 1, 2008, Eastern Pennsylvania is celebrating
        the historic launch of its very first mission church. Jim and Kori Powell will move
        out from their mother church, Cornerstone PCA, this summer to plant West Valley
        Church.</p>
    <p>
        <b>New Jersey</b> &mdash; As Ernie Banks of the Chicago Cubs (1952&ndash;1971) might
        say, &ldquo;Let’s plant two!&rdquo; After three years of prayer, preparation and
        patience, the Church Planting Team in New Jersey is scrambling to work with two
        church planters on their proposals to plant in Mullica Hill and Atlantic City. Once
        these deals are done, I’ll be able to announcement their names. But for now, the
        team members and I are working furiously to see these first churches planted in
        New Jersey since the realignment of the presbytery in 1997. These are exciting times
        for all concerned.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Philadelphia City</b> &mdash; This month the city presbytery will be asked to
        recognize a Mission to Albanians, lead by Jason Stryd and Martin Katro. Both men
        serve the Lord as missionaries to Albanian speaking immigrants in Northeast Philadelphia.
        Thousands of Albanians have fled the troubles in their homeland since 1999, many
        settling in our area. The Albanian Mission will give official recognition to their
        spiritual needs and to these two good men who serve this population for Christ.</p>
    <p>
        Elder candidates have been examined, the pastor has been called, a commission has
        been appointed, and a petition to organized Cresheim Valley Church has been approved
        for Sunday, May 11th, 2008 at a service held at Chestnut Hill Academy. Congratulations
        to pastor John Leonard, the newly elected Elders, and to the founding members of
        this new church.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Philadelphia Metro West</b> &mdash; On behalf of the presbytery and our Partnership,
        I want to thank Dennis Brown for his long and faithful service to the cause of church
        planting in metro Philadelphia. Dennis and his wife Kay have accepted a call to
        minister in Taipei, Taiwan and will leave by the end of August. Dennis was a key
        leader in the formation of the new presbytery, working to keep church planting a
        high priority. He served as the first leader of the Church Planting Team for Metro
        West, and as a valued member of my Oversight Counsel for the Partnership. We already
        miss him, and he’s not gone yet. I pray for the Father’s riches blessing for Dennis
        and Kay as they respond to God’s call.</p>
