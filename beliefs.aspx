    <h4>
        Beliefs</h4>
    <p>
        The Bible is the written word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit and without error
        in the original manuscripts. The Bible is the revelation of God's truth and is infallible
        and authoritative in all matters of life and practice.</p>
    <p>
        We believe in the Holy Trinity. There is one God, who exists eternally in three
        persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</p>
    <p>
        All are sinners and totally unable to be saved from God's displeasure, except by
        His mercy.</p>
    <p>
        Salvation is by God alone, as He Sovereignly chooses those He will save. We believe
        His choice is based on His grace, not on any human individual merit, or foreseen
        faith.</p>
    <p>
        Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God, who through His perfect life and sacrificial
        death atoned for the sins of all who will trust in Him, alone, for salvation.</p>
    <p>
        God is gracious and faithful to His people not simply as individuals but as families
        in successive generations according to His Covenant promises.</p>
    <p>
        The Holy Spirit indwells God's people and gives them strength and wisdom to trust
        Christ and follow Him.</p>
    <p>
        Jesus will return, bodily and visibly, to judge all mankind and to receive His people
        unto Himself.</p>
    <p>
        All aspects of our lives are to be lived to the Glory of God under the Lordship
        of Jesus Christ.</p>
    <p>
        God has given prayer both as a forum for intimate communion with Him and as a means
        ordained by Him for the accomplishment of His will and the advancement of His kingdom.</p>
