        What is extraordinary is that while we were without God and without hope in the
        world, separated from our Creator God in our sinfulness, unable to do anything to
        save ourselves from the judgment of God and consequences of our sinful rebellion,
        God took <span style="font-style: italic;">initiative</span>. God, the Holy One
        who was wronged, set his undeserved, unexpected and unmerited love on sinners to
        save them.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Genesis+3:14-15&height=300&width=300" title="Genesis 3:14-15"
            style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> Notice God’s initiative
        in saving his people from their sins:</p>
    <blockquote>
        But God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners…<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+5:8&height=300&width=300"
            title="Romans 5:8" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> We…
        were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        God, being rich in mercy, because the great love with which he loved us, even when
        we were dead in our trespasses…<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Ephesians+2:3-4&height=300&width=300"
            title="Ephesians 2:3-4" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a></blockquote>
    <p>
        God took this initiative not because he had to or because he saw anything worthy
        in us,<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Deuteronomy+7:7-8&height=300&width=300" title="Deuteronomy 7:7-8"
            style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> but only because of his
        own decision.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Ephesians+1:4-5&height=300&width=300" title="Ephesians 1:4-5"
            style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> The Bible expresses this
        in three ways:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1em;">
        <li>God set his <span style="font-style: italic;">love</span> on sinners in spite of
            their rebellion.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+9:10-13&height=300&width=300"
                title="Romans 9:10-13" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
            In the Bible God’s love is an act of his will to save.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+8:28-29&height=300&width=300"
                title="Romans 8:28-29" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
            God’s justice is not the <span style="font-style: italic;">opposite</span> of his
            love. Rather, God’s just wrath is the <span style="font-style: italic;">backdrop</span>
            to his love.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+5:8-9&height=300&width=300" title="Romans 5:8-9"
                style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> If the dark and bleak
            backdrop of God’s wrath is removed, the brilliant glory and warmth of his love is
            dimmed. The teaching of the Bible is that "God so loved the world that he gave his
            only Son that whoever believes in him will not <span style="font-style: italic;">perish</span>…"<a
                href="scripture.ashx?ref=John+3:16&height=300&width=300" title="John 3:16" style="text-decoration: none;"
                class="thickbox">^</a> Remove the backdrop (the "perish" of God’s wrath), and
            the love doesn’t make any sense.</li>
        <li>To those who deserve condemnation and eternal punishment in satisfaction of his
            justice, God shows <span style="font-style: italic;">mercy</span>.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+9:15-18&height=300&width=300"
                title="Romans 9:15-18" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
            Mercy does <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> give a person what he or
            she deserves. Mercy spares justice due. The Bible says, "But when the goodness and
            loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done
            by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy."<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Titus+3:4-5&height=300&width=300"
                title="Titus 3:4-5" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a></li>
        <li>If mercy does not give us what we do deserve, <span style="font-style: italic;">
            grace</span><a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+11:6&height=300&width=300" title="Romans 11:6"
                style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> gives us what we do not
            deserve. To say that God’s salvation (rescue from sin for eternal life) is by grace
            means that it comes to us as a <span style="font-style: italic;">gift</span>. It
            is not something we can earn by our efforts at obeying God’s law or by trying to
            make up for the sin we have done in the past. A gift is free, not something we deserve.
            Salvation does not come by turning over a new leaf or trying harder, but by the
            grace of God to bestow new life.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=John+3:3;+1+Corinthians+15:50;+Ezekiel+36:26-27&height=300&width=300"
                title="John 3:3; 1 Corinthians 15:50; Ezekiel 36:26-27" style="text-decoration: none;"
                class="thickbox">^</a> In fact, the Bible says that "by grace you have been
            saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not
            a result of works, so that no one may boast."<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Ephesians+2:8-9&height=300&width=300"
                title="Ephesians 2:8-9" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
            Faith comes as a gift of new life.</li>

        As sinners we are unlovely and unlovable. Yet, amazingly, God set his love upon
        sinners such as us to provide salvation and to restore that broken relationship.
        But that begs the question, how can we as <span style="font-style: italic;">sinners</span>
