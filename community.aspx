        <strong>Covenant Keepers</strong> is a monthly dinner and study to provide instruction
        and support for parents of children 0&ndash;12 years of age in raising their children
        within God's covenant framework. Emphasis is on God's wisdom contained in His Word,
        and on a Christ-centeredness and Christ-reliance for both parents and children in
        helping parents to keep their baptismal vows to raise their children in the nurture
        and admonition of the Lord. Two weeks from now, the Covenant Keepers will meet on
        <strong>Friday, May 30th</strong>, for a May/June combination meeting to be held
        at Sian Sumner's home at <strong>6 p.m.</strong> Please indicate to Sian if you
        plan to attend. <span style="text-decoration: underline">If interested in learning more,</span>
        please indicate this on the tear-off section of the bulletin or see Pastor Gale.
