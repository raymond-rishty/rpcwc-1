    <p>
        To the Saints,</p>
    <p>
        I Thessalonians 5/25: &lsquo;Brethren, Pray for us.&rsquo;</p>
    <p>
        In hind-sight it began October 19, the day of Martine's nasty fall and has
        continued even as I write: &lsquo;spiritual opposition&rsquo;. Our first experiences
        were in the early 1970s; we were young Christians at &lsquo;L'Abri&rsquo;.
        Reading Johanna Michaelsen's book &lsquo;The Beautiful Side of Evil&rsquo;,
        she recounts what she experienced at L'Abri; many of us felt, what for want
        of a better term: the presence of evil; she could literally see it! &mdash;You may
        also wish to read &lsquo;The Man in the Leather Hat&rsquo; by Paul Long, Sr.</p>
    <p>
        Earlier in the day on Oct. 19, I had done street evangelism training with a young
        French pastor here in Marseille. We were both greatly encouraged by what the Lord
        had done. Now, while we are aware intellectually that &lsquo;our wrestling is not
        against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against
        the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in
        the heavenly places&rsquo; (Eph 6/12); our lives do not always reflect this reality.
        Francis Schaeffer would remind us that we needed to be where the battles were taking
        place, and that there would be a cost. He is still correct.</p>
    <p>
        Lots and lots of little setbacks, prayer and the Lord's word constantly in
        use: illnesses striking a young French pastor, even as I arrived at his doorstep,
        thus having to cancel mentoring and training after a 5 hour drive from Marseille;
        people who walk away from relationships and communion in the church with hardened,
        embittered attitudes; additional last minute cancellations of mentoring, training
        and teaching, all of which had been planned for months, due once again to illness
        of the French pastor; then, a personal health issue: my left hip &lsquo;locked-up&rsquo;;
        x-rays revealed serious bone degeneration with need for surgery; this took place
        Feb 11: a total hip replacement! &mdash;The recovery proceeds normally, for which
        we are thankful.</p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, we also experience the Lord's mercies in answer to your
        prayers! In our Autumn Prayer letter, you remember that you prayed for Daniel dying
        of cancer who was unable to bring himself to pray, nor confess the Lord. Praise
        the Lord, just several days before his death; as I articulated a prayer of faith
        in the Lord Jesus, he acknowledged Him with tears of joy! You also prayed for Eric
        and Mylene; and the baptism of their son. Well everything fell a part: they separated,
        canceled the baptism and sold their apartment; then this past week they have been
        reconciled! Now while Eric remains closed to the Gospel; he is now understanding
        and supportive of Mylene. Her sister Danielle has come back to the Lord and His
        church after many years of spiritual indifference; thanks for praying!
    </p>
    <p>
        Please continue to remember Samuel, 28, depressed, on medication, and while a believer
        remains &lsquo;imprisoned&rsquo; in his mind, remember Ps 107. Helene, twice divorced,
        who loves the Lord and ministers to others is encouraged by the signs of spiritual
        life in the man in prison, and her friend with cancer. Please continue to pray for
        the church in France, particularly her pastors. Oh yes, the Gideons are going to
        use a better translation!</p>
    <p>
        The following is a testimony, translated, of a young French pastor, who with his
        wife are involved in a church plant: &ldquo;During Hugh's last visit to St
        Girons -a small town about 50 miles south of Toulouse, where three valleys converge
        in the foothills of the Pyrenees- he proposed to demonstrate how to engage people
        in discussions related to questions of faith.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;Another member of the church and I accepted, not without, mind you, a certain
        apprehension; at least we could say &lsquo;been there, done that!&rsquo; Indeed,
        for several months we recognized that we needed to make an effort to meet people
        where they are, instead of waiting, passively, for the population to cross the threshold
        of the church! But, we knew this also implied a sort of dying to oneself! Particularly
        for a phlegmatic, such as I, to speak to a total stranger asking for his help, not
        something I would do alone. On the other hand, the question we keep asking ourselves:
        Why are people no longer interested in Christianity? Is it the fault of we who call
        ourselves Christians? The fault of the church?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;After some preliminary practical directives; Hugh reminded us that we needed
        the following: a genuine desire to listen and dialogue; dependence upon the Holy
        Sprit; spiritual wisdom and intelligence; Spirit given humility and boldness; love
        for people; and finally, that God would set the preordained &lsquo;divine appointments&rsquo;.
        No sooner than we leave the church, Hugh begins to talk with a lady, who expresses
        that she remains angry with God, because of the death of her only son in a motorcycle
        accident 15 years earlier; then she spontaneously gives me, as the pastor, her address
        without anyone asking! Can you imagine our joyful surprise! Had God answered our
        prayers?!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;It was soon time for us to go it alone; Hugh explained, very patiently, that
        there was no need to be insistent, manipulating, nor pressure people, in other words:
        be human! In reality, what Hugh was reminding us of: our need to be ever more Christ-like,
        so that people, with their a priories, might see a pale reflection of the Lord's
        image in us.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;The surprise was on us; as we experienced first hand that everyone was willing
        to help us by answering our qustions! During the couple of hours we spent in the
        &lsquo;public square&rsquo;, people were at first intrigued, but very quickly took
        the discussion into their personal lives! A little like the 70 disciples of Jesus,
        after this brief mission, we were filled with joy at what God had done.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;We admit that such an experience is enriching and revitalizing spiritually.
        Indeed, it helped me as a pastor, to see that my Biblical reformation theology is
        not incompatible with the Gospel, which is a criticism often leveled at our Presbyterian
        churches; rather it put flesh on my theology: a spirit of prayer, counting on divine
        Providence to guide us to those of His choosing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;At the end of the day, we rejoiced in prayer at what the Lord had done!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        &ldquo;P.S. Before departing, Hugh stated very simply, &lsquo;you realize of course
        that you need to this regularly, at least two hours per week; and teach others too!
        A great big thanks to Hugh for his teaching us evangelism!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>
        May the Lord be pleased to grant you His presence; as you face your trials, illnesses,
        financial hardships, broken relationships, etc. May His peace and joy accompany
        you in all your ways!</p>
    <p>
        Martine joins me in thanking you for many signs of affection, care, concern, support
        and prayers.</p>
    <p>
        In Christ the Lamb,</p>
    <p>
        Hugh and Martine</p>
    <p>
        P.S. We are pleased to announce the marriage of our daughter, Laurence, May 17 !</p>
