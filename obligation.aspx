        God's good news is that he has accomplished the salvation of sinners through the
        work of his Son, Jesus Christ. That which we could never do nor would we ever deserve,
        God did in Christ. He reconciled people to himself, not counting their sins against
        them.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=2+Corinthians+5:19&height=300&width=300" title="2 Corinthians 5:19"
            style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> Not that those sins were
        ignored; quite the contrary, they were met head on in all their ugliness and violence
        by the Son of God. God has made Jesus Lord and Christ.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Acts+2:36&height=300&width=300"
            title="Acts 2:36" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> Our
        response is to humble ourselves before Jesus as the risen Lord he is.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Philippians+2:5-11&height=300&width=300"
            title="Philippians 2:5-11" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
        As the Bible says:</p>
    <blockquote>
        If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that
        God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes
        and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture
        says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+10:9-11&height=300&width=300"
            title="Romans 10:9-11" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a></blockquote>
    <p>
        God's gracious invitation is to turn to his Son, Jesus Christ, and follow him. What
        is involved in following Christ? The Bible describes three proper reactions to this
        Jesus who is Savior of sinners and Lord of life.</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 1em;">
        <li>We are to <span style="font-style: italic;">repent</span>.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Luke+24:45-47&height=300&width=300"
            title="Luke 24:45-47" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> Repentance
            is not merely being sorry for something. It is turning from our sinful rebellion
            against God, out of a deep awareness of our sin and sorrow<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Joel+2:12-13&height=300&width=300"
                title="Joel 2:12-13" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> over
            that sin because it dishonors and displeases God.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=2+Corinthians+7:8-10&height=300&width=300"
                title="2 Corinthians 7:8-10" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a>
            Repentance (1) turns from any effort to be our own savior, trying to do something
            to earn salvation; and (2) turns from being our own lord, living our lives independent
            of God.</li>
        <li>Not only are we to turn <span style="font-style: italic;">from</span>, we are to
            turn <span style="font-style: italic;">to</span>.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=1+Thessalonians+1:9-10&height=300&width=300"

            We are to repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. This is what the Bible calls
            "<span style="font-style: italic;">faith</span>." Such faith (1) knows the facts
            (about sin and where salvation is found), (2) admits they are true, and (3) places
            sole trust and confidence in God's provision for sinners&mdash;Jesus Christ.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Romans+1:16-17;+Romans+4:23-25;+Romans+10:9-10&height=300&width=300"

            We are justified (declared 'not guilty') in God's sight not by our efforts at obedience

            title="John 10:10" style="text-decoration: none;" class="thickbox">^</a> Perhaps
        the most amazing thing is this: the relationship to which God brings us is not just

        trust in) him are given the right to become children of God.<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=John+1:12-13;+John+20:31;+Galatians+4:4-5&height=300&width=300"
