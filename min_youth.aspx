<h4>Youth Ministry</h4>
<p>Youth ministry at RPC for junior and senior high students, called ‘SLIC’ (Students Living in Christ) is building momentum with big plans for the future.  Right now students meet monthly for some activity, fellowship and study of a biblical topic.   SLIC will have space to call its own once the renovations of the RPC Ministry House are completed.  God has raised up a variety of adult and students leaders.</p>
