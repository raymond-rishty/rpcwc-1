    <p>
        Youth ministry at RPC for junior and senior high students, called ‘SLIC’ (Students
        Living in Christ) is building momentum with big plans for the future. Right now
        students meet monthly for some activity, fellowship and study of a biblical topic.
        SLIC will have space to call its own once the renovations of the RPC Ministry House
        are completed. God has raised up a variety of adult and students leaders.</p>
