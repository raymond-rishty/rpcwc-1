    <h4>Small Group Locations</h4>
    <p>
        Cluster Groups are the small group ministry of RPC, where we gather for fellowship,
        study and prayer. All members of RPC are encouraged to be part of a Cluster, where
        they are known and encouraged in the faith and able to encourage others. For those
        who want to feel more connected to fellow believers in the church, Clusters are
        the place!
