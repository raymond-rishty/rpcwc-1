<h4>Women's Study</h4>
<p>Nancy Carlson will lead a study of the book, <em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/5190" target="_blank">Prayer of Jehoshaphat: Seeing Beyond Life's Storm</a></em> by Dr. Stanley D. Gale (see description below).</p>
<p><strong>Book description</strong>: The Prayer of Jehoshaphat develops King Jehoshaphat’s prayer in 2 Chronicles 20 to give us focus, stability, strength, courage and direction in times of great distress. In the overwhelming circumstances that enter our lives, it directs us to take hold of the hand of our God who leads us from the point of crisis to gather up His blessings for us deposited by the storm. Each chapter can serve as a workstation where we bring others or linger ourselves with God, wrestling with the perspective brought to bear on our need, as we follow the movement from bleakness to blessing.</p>

<blockquote>“God is honored when His children turn to Him in faithful prayer in times of distress. Too often, however, the force of trouble's impact stuns us into shocked silence. Where do we find our "prayer voice" when our world lies in shambles, fear paralyzes our thinking, and vicious foes threaten everything we hold dear? Stan Gale points us to the prayer of Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles 20. His rich insights into God's instruction on prayer provide encouraging and practical help for those who desire to pray with God's perspective for the greater display of His glory in the midst of all manner of trying circumstances.”</blockquote>
