        Every Sunday morning children from Junior and senior high ages meet together to
        learn more about Christ and what He means to them in their lives. This age is a
        difficult time in children's lives with many peer pressures, emotional highs and
        lows, spiritual questions, and many other struggles. This Sunday bible school is
        designed to answer questions the class may have and also to guide them through life
        showing them who Christ is and why our lives are completely empty without him. By
        communicating this to them it sets the tone for relying on Christ and not self for
        all the struggles life may bring them.</p>

        For the Spring quarter the class will be studying stories from the book of Acts.
        Starting with the death and resurrection of Jesus, we see God showing His love for
        His people. We will then look at the gift of the Holy Spirit and the men and women
        God raised up to carry on His message of Jesus as the Christ.</p>

        <strong>Bible Story Hour </strong>

        In the Children's Bible Story Hour we study the Bible with an eye towards the needs
        and abilities of the toddler age group. Lesson are taken from the David C. Cooke
        curriculum which is activity based as toddlers need to march, clap, dance, sing,
        and jump up and down as Mrs. Brown and her downstairs class can attest. It is encouraging
        when one hears the report that a child constantly sings the songs from class at
        home during the week. It is mandatory to have fun while studying the Bible in this
        class.</p>
