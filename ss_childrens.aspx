        Every Sunday morning children from Grades 5 through Senior High meet together to
        learn more about Christ and what He means to them in their lives. This age is a
        difficult time in children's lives with many peer pressures, emotional highs and
        lows, spiritual questions, and many other struggles. This class is designed to answer
        questions the class may have and also to guide the students through life showing
        them who Christ is and why our lives are completely empty without Him. Communicating
        this to them sets the tone for relying on Christ and not self for all the struggles
        life may bring.</p>

        This year we will be studying first from the book of Exodus and learning how to
        apply the 10 Commandments in our lives. Then we'll be studying the book of Acts
        and learning how God spread His Kingdom after Christ's time on earth. Finally, we
        will be looking at little known people from the Old and New Testament who were servants
        of God.</p>
    <p>
        Besides studying God's Word, we also play games, sing, do scripture memory and have
        friendly competitions in class</p>

        We will be learning many Bible truths this year. Truths such as God takes care of
        us, God sent Jesus to save us from our sins, God loves and helps us trust and obey
        Him and many, many more. We look forward to using Bible stories, songs and scripture
        memory and games to help us remember all that we learn.</p>

        In the Children's Bible Story Hour, we study the Bible with an eye towards the needs
        and abilities of the toddler age group. Lessons are taken from the David C. Cooke
        curriculum which is activity based as toddlers need to march, clap, dance, sing,
        and jump up and down. It is encouraging to hear the report that a child constantly
        sings the songs from class at home during the week. It is mandatory to have fun
        while studying the Bible in this class!</p>
