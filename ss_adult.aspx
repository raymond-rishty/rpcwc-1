    <p>
        In this video series, Tedd Tripp walks the viewer through the core content of his
        book <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/product-exec/product_id/2289/nm/Shepherding_a_Child_s_Heart_Revised_and_Updated"
            target="_blank">Shepherding a Child&#39;s Heart</a>, which is about how to speak
        to the heart of the child. The things your child does and says flow from the heart
        (<a href="scripture.ashx?ref=Luke+6:45&height=300&width=300" title="Luke
        6:45" class="thickbox">Luke 6:45</a>). From the fundamental biblical passages that
        define what good parenting is Dr. Tripp describes both the concepts and the methods
        in lively detail. His wealth of experience as a parent, a school administrator,
        and a pastor are evident in his stories and insights as he teaches the principles
        of biblical parenting.&nbsp; Meets in fellowship hall.</p>
