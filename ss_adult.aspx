                Community Houses of Prayer (CHOP) is a ministry tool to equip and involve believers
                in evangelistic prayer as they seek to draw near to people for Christ and draw near
                to Christ for people. CHOP incorporates weekly group meetings and daily private
                prayer to renew participants in God's grace, to shape attitudes as instruments for
                Christ in their life-spheres to train in the discipline of kingdom prayer and to
                engage in communicating the gospel.

                God’s counsel in Acts 20:28 is for shepherds to keep watch over themselves and the
                sheep God has placed under their care. This is no more pointed than in parents shepherding
                their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, in the exercise of their
                covenant vows. This quarter the group will study Give Them Grace: Dazzling Your
                Kids With the Love of Jesus.
