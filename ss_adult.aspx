    <p>
        Many believe that we are totally free to choose salvation. In Willing to Believe,
        R.C. shows that man's will is not free but in bondage to sin. He says that
        we are doomed unless God has mercy and changes our hearts. R.C. examines the issue
        of free will throughout history, looking at the views of Augustine, Pelagius, Luther,
        Calvin, Arminius, Edwards, Finney, and others. R.C. demonstrates that some assumptions
        about &ldquo;free will&rdquo; undermine the Gospel and conceal God's glory
        in salvation. (click <a href="https://store.ligonier.org/product.asp?idDept=D&amp;idCategory=TH&amp;idProduct=WIL01DC"
