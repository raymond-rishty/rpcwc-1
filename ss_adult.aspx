        Classes will generally run along a quarter system (13 weeks), with new offerings
        starting at the same time in the fall, winter and spring. However, since classes
        within a quarter may be staggered (i.e., differing number of sessions), students
        are welcome to join in an ongoing class, provided there is room, for the duration
        of the quarter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">

    <p>
        Those not part of a class or between classes are invited to gather with others in
        the parlor of the Ministry House <b>for prayer</b>, praying through the weekly prayer sheet
        and the order of service and activities in that Sunday’s bulletin.
