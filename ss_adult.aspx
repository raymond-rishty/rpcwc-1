introduces people to Jesus Christ, using the Gospel of Mark to answer three
questions: Who is Jesus? Why did he come? What does it mean to follow him?

profound simplicity.</p>

seeks genuine, relational witness to the Lord Jesus in actions that serve Him and
words that give Him glory.” (CHOP Ministry Manual, p. 83). This course will
provide tactical and practical training for reaching those around us for the sake
of the gospel. Over the 12 weeks, we will learn how to cultivate a mentality of
mission and initiate conversations for Christ through classroom instruction and
field application. (<a href="pdf/evangliving_syllabus.pdf">see syllabus</a>).</p>

        Classes will generally run along a quarter system (13 weeks), with new offerings
        starting at the same time in the fall, winter and spring. However, since classes
        within a quarter may be staggered (i.e., differing number of sessions), students
        are welcome to join in an ongoing class, provided there is room, for the duration
        of the quarter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        OR</p>
    <p>
        Those not part of a class or between classes are invited to gather with others in
        the parlor of the Ministry House <b>for prayer</b>, praying through the weekly prayer sheet
        and the order of service and activities in that Sunday’s bulletin.
