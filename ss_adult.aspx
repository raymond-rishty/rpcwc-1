                best-known -- and least understood -- parable. The Prodigal God is a revelation
                of the very heart of the gospel: God's radical love for sinners of every kind. Copies
                of Dr. Keller’s book will be available for purchase</p>

                read and taught many Bible studies, but never have I come across a study as well
                written and thought-out as Job: Lessons in Comfort. All thirteen lessons constantly
                point us not to Job or his situation but to our covenant-keeping God who has perfect,
                loving control of every aspect of our lives, even when it seems He is clueless to
                our needs.” — Dennis Bennett</p>

                describes addiction as a “worship disorder” and discusses the power of the gospel
                to deliver from the grip of addiction and into the freedom of the power of new life
                in Christ. Copies of Dr. Welch’s book will be available for purchase.</p>

        Classes will generally run along a quarter system (12 weeks), with new offerings
        starting at the same time in the fall, winter and spring. However, since classes
        within a quarter may be staggered (i.e., differing number of sessions), students
        are welcome to join in an ongoing class, provided there is room, for the duration
        of the quarter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        OR</p>
    <p>
        Those not part of a class or between classes are invited to gather with others in
        the parlor of the Ministry House for prayer, praying through the weekly prayer sheet
        and the order of service and activities in that Sunday’s bulletin.
