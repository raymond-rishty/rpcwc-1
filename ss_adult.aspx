        Classes will generally run along a quarter system (12 weeks), with new offerings
        starting at the same time in the fall, winter and spring. However, since classes
        within a quarter may be staggered (i.e., differing number of sessions), students
        are welcome to join in an ongoing class, provided there is room, for the duration
        of the quarter.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        OR</p>
    <p>
        Those not part of a class or between classes are invited to gather with others in
        the parlor of the Ministry House for prayer, praying through the weekly prayer sheet
        and the order of service and activities in that Sunday’s bulletin.
