    <h4>The Lord's Supper</h4>
    <h3>
        What is the Lord’s Supper?</h3>
    <p>
        The Lord’s Supper, also known as Communion, is a sacrament (a visible sign and seal
        given by God) that belongs to the visible community of God’s people, the church
        of Jesus Christ. Just as the old covenant Passover meal celebrated the saving work
        of God through a slain substitute, so the Lord’s Supper is the new covenant celebration
        of God’s true and ultimate saving work through the death of His Son as the actual
        substitute sacrificed for sinners.</p>
    <p>
        The Lord’s Supper is not a re-sacrifice of Christ. Rather, it is a remembrance of
        His one-time sacrificial death. Neither is the Lord’s Supper a mere memorial meal,
        because, while it does remember the death of Christ, our communion is not with a
        dead Christ but with a living Savior, risen in victory. Christ is truly present
        in the elements used in a special way. He is not physically present, but spiritually.
        The Supper is a means of grace, strengthening the faith of believers and helping
        them to grow in the grace and knowledge of their Lord and Savior.</p>
    <h3>
        Who may participate in the Lord’s Supper?</h3>
    <p>
        The sacrament is not just for those who belong to this local church, but for those
        who belong to any expression of Christ’s church, where the gospel is proclaimed
        and the Word of God upheld.
