    <h4>
        The FAQs about sin</h4>
    <dl>
        <dt>Q: What exactly is sin?</dt>
        <dd>
            A: Sin is breaking the law of God in thought, word or deed, not doing what God commands
            or doing what he forbids. Jesus explained that lusting in our hearts was a violation
            of God's command not to commit adultery, or hating another person breaks God's command
            not to murder.</dd>
        <dt>Q: But am I a sinner?</dt>
        <dd>
            A: The Bible says that everyone is a sinner. We sin because we are born sinners.
            Sin involves not only our acts of disobedience, but includes our hearts that are
            full of sin and in rebellion against God.</dd>
        <dt>Q: But I know plenty of people worse than I am.</dt>
        <dd>
            A: God's standard is not other people. His standard is his own perfect holiness.
            God gives us his moral law to compare ourselves to, not other sinners. Jesusâ€™ point
            in saying that even our thought life breaks God's law makes it clear that every
            one of us is a sinner and that we <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span>
            be good enough to measure up to God's standard of perfection.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Won't God give me a break if I try to be good and to obey his commandments?</dt>
        <dd>
            A: Often we think of sin as those <span style="font-style: italic">big</span> crimes
            like murder, but the Bible says if we do any wrong we fall short of God's standard
            of perfection necessary for salvation and so are guilty before him. And God must
            and will punish eternally all who are guilty.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Isn't that awfully severe? It doesn't seem fair.</dt>
        <dd>
            A: We don't grasp just how <span style="font-style: italic">serious</span> sin is
            because we don't understand just how <span style="font-style: italic">holy</span>
            God is. God's judgment on sin is fair and just. Not to punish sin would be to make
            God unjust.</dd>
        <dt>Q: Can't I just try harder to obey God's commandments?</dt>
        <dd>
            A: The Bible says even our very best efforts are contaminated by our sinful hearts.
            Also, God <span style="font-style:italic">must</span> exact the justice his holiness demands for the sins we have committed.
            If it was just a matter of trying harder Jesus would not have had to die.</dd>
        <dt>Q: But won't God forgive my sins if I confess them?</dt>
        <dd>
            A: Yes, but not just because you confess them. God forgives sins only through his
            provision for sin that meets the demands of his justice and provides what is necessary
            to be right with Him. Forgiveness of sin comes only from the saving work of Jesus
            and our resting in that work by faith. (see <a href="scripture.ashx?ref=1+John+1:8-2:2&height=300&width=300"
